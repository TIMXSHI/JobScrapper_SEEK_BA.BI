This is a rare opportunity for an FP&A Manager to step into a highly visible role where financial insight genuinely shapes business direction.

Joining a growing, technology-led organisation, you'll sit at the centre of planning, performance, and strategic analysis. Your work will directly inform executive discussions, investment decisions, and operational priorities, making this an ideal role for someone who enjoys influence, ownership, and problem-solving at scale.

Own financial planning cycles, including budgets, forecasts, and long-range outlook
Develop commercial models to assess growth initiatives, pricing decisions, and profitability

Why This Role Stands Out:

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, 你好, hallo, vítejte!
Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be time-consuming, so let’s get straight to the point.

Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney, with additional spaces in Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide. You have the flexibility to work from the office, home, or a mix of both—it’s your choice. We trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals.

Job Description


What you’d be doing in this role

As Canva scales, change is part of our DNA. While your role will evolve over time, here’s a flavour of what you’ll be working on when you start:

Leading Product Analytics Engineering: Own and lead the Analytics Engineering function for the Product Org, with Product AEs reporting to you and the team expected to grow over time.

Driving Analytics Architecture of the Future: Define, own, and evolve Canva’s Product Analytics Engineering architecture, including modular data domains, semantic layers, metrics systems, and AI-ready foundations.

Elevating Analytics Engineering (AE) Craft: Set clear standards and best practices for analytics engineering across Product, and coach AEs across levels to consistently deliver high-quality, scalable data assets.

Partnering Across Product & Data: Work closely with Product Managers, Data Scientists, Engineers, and Platform teams to translate complex product needs into robust, reusable analytics solutions.

Balancing Strategy and Delivery: Combine long-term architectural thinking with pragmatic execution, ensuring AE effort is focused on the highest-impact Product initiatives.

Acting as a Technical Leader: Be the senior escalation point for complex analytics problems and represent Analytics Engineering perspectives in Product and Data leadership forums.

Enabling Product Decisions: Ensure analytics foundations enable product discovery, experimentation, launches, and long-term strategy, helping teams confidently understand user behaviour, product performance, and the impact of their decisions.

Hands-on Where It Matters Most: Get actively involved in complex or high-leverage analytics engineering work, while setting the technical direction for the team.

You're probably a match if…

You have extensive experience across Analytics Engineering, Data Engineering, or Software Engineering roles.

You’ve led and coached Analytics Engineering teams, including managing senior engineers and growing teams.

You’re deeply experienced with modern data platforms and tooling (e.g. SQL-based warehouses such as Snowflake, dbt-style transformations, orchestration, and semantic layers).

You have strong opinions (weakly held) — backed by experience — on data modelling, analytics architecture, and platform scalability and are eager to try new approaches.

You’re comfortable operating at the intersection of technical depth, people leadership, and strategy.

You thrive on collaboration and can communicate clearly with both highly technical partners and senior non-technical stakeholders.

You care deeply about data quality, reliability, performance, and cost efficiency.

About the team

Analytics Engineering sits within Canva’s broader Data ecosystem. The Product Analytics Engineering team partners closely with Product, Design and Engineering to ensure Canva’s product decisions are powered by trusted, timely, and scalable data foundations.

What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard—and we do—but you’ll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity, and fun woven throughout life at Canva. Here’s a taste of what’s on offer:

Equity packages: We want our success to be yours too.

Inclusive parental leave policy: Supporting all parents and carers.

Annual Vibe & Thrive allowance: Supporting your wellbeing, social connection, office setup, and more.

Flexible leave options: Empowering you to recharge and take time for what matters most.

Other stuff to know

We value unique experiences and skills. If you don’t meet every requirement but feel passionate about this role, we’d still love to hear from you.

We make hiring decisions based on your experience, skills, and passion, as well as how you can enhance Canva and its culture. Let us know your pronouns and any reasonable adjustments you may need during the interview process.
