About the Role

We're seeking a driven and experienced Senior Business Analyst to join a finance transformation program within the financial services sector. This is a business-focused role - not a technology BA position - suited to someone with domain knowledge and a track record of delivering change across finance processes, reporting, and controls.

The successful candidate will play a key role in shaping and delivering improvements to processes, and systems, working closely with finance stakeholders to drive meaningful transformation.


Key Responsibilities
Partner with finance teams to analyse, document, and optimise business processes and workflows.

Lead requirements gathering and process mapping for finance transformation initiatives (e.g. GL, reporting, reconciliations, controls).

Define and document current-state and target-state processes, identifying improvement opportunities.

Collaborate with stakeholders to ensure business needs are captured and solutions are fit-for-purpose.

Support delivery and implementation of finance process and system changes (in partnership with technology where needed).

Develop and maintain business documentation including BRDs, process maps, test scripts, and training materials.

Support UAT, business readiness, and post-implementation review activities.

Provide actionable insights and recommendations to enhance finance efficiency and accuracy.

Agile Environment Proficiency: Demonstrated ability to work effectively in an Agile environment, with strong skills in writing clear user stories, defining acceptance criteria, and managing a product backlog.
Core Analytical Skills: Master of core BA disciplines, including requirements elicitation and management, process mapping (As-Is/To-Be), gap analysis, and creating detailed business requirements documentation.
BA Practice Development: Ability to contribute to the establishment and maturity of the BA practice within the Finance transformation program by championing best practices, standardising templates, and potentially mentoring other BAs.
Business-Technology Liaison: Act as the vital bridge between business stakeholders and technical delivery teams, translating business needs into clear, actionable requirements without requiring deep technical expertise.
Stakeholder Management & Communication: Exceptional stakeholder engagement skills, with the ability to manage expectations, facilitate workshops, and support change management and communications activities across the program.
End-to-End Testing Leadership: Responsibility for the business testing lifecycle, including preparing UAT scenarios and test cases, training business users for execution, and leading the UAT process to ensure solutions meet business requirements.
Independent & Proactive Drive: A proactive self-starter who thrives in a fast-paced environment and demonstrates strong initiative and a drive to achieve successful outcomes.
Ways of Working: Proven ability to collaborate effectively as part of a team and work independently when required. You must have an open, honest, and proactive communication style.
Desirable Financial Domain Knowledge: Experience in Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A), including budgeting, forecasting, and performance reporting processes, is highly desirable.
