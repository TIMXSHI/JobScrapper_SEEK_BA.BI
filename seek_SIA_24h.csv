AIHW are seeking to fill two roles:

- Group Head – Population Health Group SES Band 1; and

The Housing and Specialised Services Group comprises several units that collect and analyse data to support reporting and policy decisions on the health and welfare of Australians. The Group has a particular focus on specialised services including housing, veterans supports, drug and alcohol supports, child protection systems, youth justice systems and correctional facilities.
