About us
We're on a mission to create a brighter future, where you can be a change maker at the actual source. We're one of Australia's largest water utilities with over 30% of Victoria's population relying on us for their essential water and sanitation services.

Our award-winning culture fosters an inclusive, collaborative, and flexible environment that enables our people to thrive. Here, you'll be inspired and challenged to grow alongside us.

We're committed to reconciliation and supporting the self-determined role for Traditional Owners/Custodians in water and land management.

The Role
As the Asset Data and Information Governance Lead, you'll be at the forefront of ensuring our asset data is a reliable and valuable resource. This isn't just about managing data; it's about leading the charge to create, implement, and continuously improve standards that support every stage of an asset's life cycle. You'll operate with a high degree of autonomy, serving as a vital link between business stakeholders and technical teams. Your mission is to translate business needs into practical data and information governance initiatives, championing a culture of data-informed decision-making and helping align our systems (like AMS and GIS) with our strategic asset management goals.

Your key responsibilities

Define, implement, and maintain asset data governance standards, ensuring the data is accurate, consistent, and aligned with the organisation's overall data framework. This includes developing procedures, data audits, and quality assurance protocols to ensure data integrity and reliability.
Identify and prioritise initiatives to improve asset data quality, integration, and interoperability. You will work closely with data analytics and asset transformation teams to develop automated data pipelines that align with governance policies and support strategic decision-making.
Define and maintain governance standards for all asset information products. This involves aligning asset management systems (e.g., Maximo) and GIS with strategic objectives, regulatory requirements, and improvement initiatives to ensure that our tools meet stakeholder needs.
Take ownership of our asset and functional system classification hierarchy. You will oversee its implementation within our core systems, including the cleanup of legacy data to ensure it meets current standards and naming conventions.
Build, maintain, and optimise data models in asset intelligence systems. Your work will enable accurate and timely reporting and insights, and you'll provide expert guidance to business users on data model optimisation and visualisation best practices. You will also monitor and manage the performance of these models, troubleshooting issues and proactively identifying improvements.
Serve as the primary liaison between Asset Services and other key teams like Asset Technology & Transformation and Enterprise Data Analytics. You will facilitate collaboration, capture business requirements, and translate them into clear, actionable technical initiatives.
Work to build the capability of reporting officers and other business users. You will document report structures, processes, and metadata to ensure sustainable reporting practices and data usability across the business.

What we're looking for

Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Information Systems, Data Analytics, Engineering, or a related field.
Relevant certifications in Power BI, Azure Data Engineering, or data governance.
Knowledge of asset management standards and lifecycle planning frameworks (e.g. ISO 55000, risk-based decision-making).
Demonstrated experience in asset information management or asset data governance, including the development and maintenance of classification hierarchies.
Experience implementing and improving asset data governance frameworks, data quality standards, and compliance processes.
Advanced skills in designing and optimising semantic models in Power BI, including advanced DAX, Power Query, and data modelling best practices.
Proficiency in SQL and working knowledge of Azure-based data platforms (e.g. Azure SQL DB, Data Factory) for developing and maintaining data pipelines.
Strong interpersonal and communication skills, with demonstrated ability to translate complex business needs into technical requirements and liaise across operational, IT, and strategic teams.
Ability to lead initiatives independently, identify data or governance issues, and drive cross-functional improvements.
