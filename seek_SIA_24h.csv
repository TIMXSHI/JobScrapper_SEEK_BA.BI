Ideally you are passionate about the next generation of defense technology and love building efficient and understandable data models. You prioritize velocity and are interested in pushing the frontiers of what analytics can do within an organization - think data applications rather than just dashboards.

This role presents an exciting opportunity to be part of our team’s expansion into Australia. As the first team member in Australia, you'll be able to shape the role and team, directly influencing the work and direction of where it goes.

You are motivated by our mission. We are working to solve the biggest problems in defence
Your weekend reading usually involves authors named Kimball or Inmon or modern data modeling blogs
You’re energized by business impact & a self-starter: you’d rather build an imperfect data model quickly that is used by many people than a perfect data model that collects dust
You thrive in cross-functional projects that have a heavy combination of technical requirements and user-focused workflows
Expert with SQL and experience with Python or other programming languages
Experience with data stack tools: dbt, Redshift, Looker/Tableau, Palantir Foundry
