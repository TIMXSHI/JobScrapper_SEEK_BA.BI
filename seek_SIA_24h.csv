At BOQ Group, we’re transforming the way we think about risk—and we’re looking for a Senior Manager, Quantitative Modelling to help lead the charge. Sitting within our Group Risk division and reporting to the Head of Risk Analytics and Modelling, this role is all about shaping the future of credit risk stress testing and collective provisioning across all our credit portfolios.

You’ll be the go-to expert for designing and delivering stress testing frameworks, including those for emerging risks like climate change. You’ll also lead the monthly collective provisioning process, ensuring our models are not only robust but also insightful and responsive to regulatory expectations.

Collaboration is key here—you’ll work closely with teams across Business, Finance, and Risk, as well as with external stakeholders like auditors, regulators, and validators. And with a small team of analysts reporting to you, your leadership will help shape the next generation of talent in this space.

This is a role for someone who thrives in complexity, enjoys solving problems with data, and is passionate about making a meaningful impact in a highly regulated environment.

About You

You’re someone who brings deep expertise in credit risk, stress testing, and collective provisioning—ideally with more than eight years of experience in similar roles. You’ve got a strong foundation in mathematical and statistical modelling, and you’re comfortable working with tools like SQL, SAS, R, Python, and version control platforms like Git or Bitbucket.

What sets you apart is your ability to connect the dots between technical modelling and business context. You’re a confident communicator who can explain complex concepts to non-technical stakeholders, and you’re always curious—keen to dig deeper into data and uncover insights that drive better decisions.

You’ve led teams before and know how to bring out the best in others. You’re proactive, collaborative, and ready to roll up your sleeves to get things done. And if you’ve got experience with IFRS9, Basel, or APRA standards, that’s a definite plus.

At BOQ Group, our people are easy to spot. They’re bold, genuinely care about each other, and are committed to creating a more inclusive and innovative future. If that sounds like you, we’d love to welcome you to the team.
