Our privately owned and operated rail network is an essential part of our integrated production process and services our 16 mines across the Pilbara via almost 2,000 km of track. With rail depots located at Tom Price, Cape Lambert and Dampier (7 Mile), most trains are autonomously operated and typically comprise three locomotives and 240 ore cars stretching to approximately 2.4 kilometres in length. We are also applying and adapting technology to improve safety and productivity across our rail network.
