Design and build scalable pipelines for processing and curating large datasets of human design feedback.

Research and develop ML models to generate high-quality synthetic data for training and fine-tuning.

Own the design and implementation of human evaluation workflows, including creating guidelines and quality rubrics.

Experience with generative AI and synthetic data generation is highly desirable.

Nice to have:

Experience with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) for data storage, processing, and MLOps related to dataset management.

Experience with MLOps practices and tools specifically for data versioning, lineage, and pipeline automation.

Ability to develop data visualization or data collection interfaces (e.g., TypeScript, Python).
