Minderoo Foundation takes on tough, persistent issues with the potential to drive massive change. We incubate ideas, advocate for systems change and accelerate impact. We push the limits of what is believed possible.

Minderoo Foundation is proudly Australian, independent, forward thinking and seeks effective, scalable solutions. Through bold, collaborative and selfless action, we seek to dismantle the systems that entrench inequality and advocate for a fairer future.

Minderoo’s Natural Ecosystems Focus Area drives Minderoo's work in environment and conservation. It is dedicated to restoring and maintaining healthy ecosystems, safeguarded for all generations, focusing on the Indo-Pacific region and through our global influence. The 2030 Strategy targets this outcome for Australia and its neighbours, as we strive to act locally and think globally. Our approach emphasises the necessity of applying the Precautionary Principle to protect against serious and irreversible damage to our ecosystems and minimising climate change as a threat multiplier. We will protect and restore our natural ecosystems by fostering legislation, supporting research and development in science and technology, and developing sustainable financial models to balance the needs of our beneficiaries. We will overcome the climate challenge by supporting policy development, public education on climate urgency and demonstrating what a successful transition looks like domestically.

The aim of the Ecosystem Intelligence body of work – where this position is based – is to (i) Build foundational genomic resources for effective and holistic conservation of biodiversity (ii) Develop a suite of scalable Ecosystem Intelligence approaches to measure and model nature (iii) Empower communities and stakeholders to routinely collect samples, use data and benefit from eDNA insights (iv) Advocate for the uptake and integration of DNA data and tools in conservation and management frameworks.

About the Opportunity

Minderoo is seeking a Senior Advisor, Ecosystem Data Partnerships to play a pivotal role in advancing ecosystem intelligence through world-leading data science, AI and DNA-based tools.

Working closely with the Natural Ecosystems team, the OceanOmics Laboratory (at UWA), and an extensive global partner network, you will identify and cultivate strategic partnerships that accelerate the use and impact of biodiversity and genetic data.

This role sits at the intersection of science, strategy and impact — translating cutting-edge DNA data, models and visualisation tools into real-world outcomes that protect ecosystems today and into the future.

Key responsibilities:

Identify and cultivate partnerships with world-leading institutions and experts to advance ecosystem intelligence and data science innovation.

Provide strategic oversight and support to funded partners, including drafting funding agreements, setting milestones and shaping budgets.

Collaborate with global agencies such as GBIF, OBIS and IUCN to ensure OceanOmics data is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).

Guide the development of compelling data visualisations and modelling outputs that accelerate the adoption and impact of ecosystem monitoring tools.

Translate complex data science concepts into clear narratives by working with Natural Ecosystems colleagues, Advocacy & Engagement teams and partners to develop media content, outreach materials, scientific publications and high-impact presentations for national and international forums.

Engage across global time zones, with flexibility for meetings outside standard working hours and international travel as required.

About You

You are a strategic data science leader with deep expertise in areas such as modelling, AI or biodiversity data systems. You combine technical credibility with the ability to influence partners, shape strategy and drive measurable environmental outcomes.

You bring:

A postgraduate degree and 10 years’ post-graduate experience in data science, coupled with an active interest in how new forms of biodiversity data (e.g. eDNA) might drive outcomes in the Australia-Pacific, but also further afield. (PhD is desirable).

A deep understanding of how models, metrics, AI tools and visualisation can be used to catalyse the uptake of ecosystems data to listen to nature more effectively and make better decisions.

Technical knowledge of different programming environments, bioinformatics or data science tools.

A creative and strategic thinking mindset that is impact focussed and outcome oriented.

Experience in strategy development, project management and program development.

There is a preference for the position to be based in Perth, Western Australia - but for the right applicant a remote position may be considered. Please indicate this in your application.

Benefits

At Minderoo, you will contribute to ambitious, globally significant work to protect and restore ecosystems.

We offer:

Flexible working options

Attractive parental leave

Career development and learning opportunities

The opportunity to collaborate with leading global partners at the forefront of ecosystem science and innovation

What you will enjoy about us

You will enjoy working in a technology-led fintech where modelling sits at the heart of the product - not in a back-office function.

You will enjoy owning problems end-to-end. Not just training models, but understanding how they behave in production, how they drift, and how they influence real portfolio performance.

You will enjoy being close to decision-making. This role works directly with the CTO and engineering, where ideas move quickly and models ship fast.

You will enjoy breadth. Our data science team works across multiple problem types - credit, behavioural modelling, performance analysis and optimisation - not just one narrow ML specialism.

You will enjoy impact. When you improve something here, you see it in live metrics.

The kind of work you will be doing

Build and refine credit and behavioural models

Run deep exploratory analysis across complex, messy datasets

Monitor production models and diagnose performance shifts

Analyse portfolio trends and identify performance leakage

Partner closely with engineers to deploy and iterate

Influence commercial and product decisions with structured modelling insight

This is hands-on modelling inside a live product environment.

You will enjoy this if

You prefer product companies over institutional environments

You like models that ship and evolve - not models that sit in approval cycles

You care about statistical rigour and commercial outcomes equally

You are comfortable working inside engineering sprint cycles

You have seen real-world model behaviour and learned from it

You likely come from a tech-led fintech, SaaS, scale-up or consulting background where modelling directly influenced product or revenue performance.

What we work with

AWS

Airflow

Python for analysis

JavaScript and TypeScript in product

Experience deploying and monitoring models in production environments will feel natural here.

What this role is not
