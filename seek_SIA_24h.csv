You’ve worked on complex technology programs where the detail genuinely mattered. You’ve untangled integrations, mapped data flows across systems that don’t naturally talk to each other, and asked the questions that prevent delivery issues from surfacing too late.

But you may be craving more meaning from the work itself.

This role sits at the intersection of technology and humanity. The platforms you help shape will support Australians at some of the most vulnerable moments of their lives, when they are seeking information, guidance, and reassurance following a cancer diagnosis.

Here, business analysis is not an abstract exercise. Your work directly influences how quickly someone reaches the right support, how seamlessly services connect across states, and how equitably care is delivered nationwide.

That’s what makes this role different, and why experienced Business Analysts choose to move now.

About the role

Reporting to the Stream Delivery Lead – Customer Experience, you will play a critical role in the National Cancer Navigation Service Program, a major national initiative transforming how people affected by cancer access information and support.

You will be responsible for eliciting, analysing, and documenting detailed business, functional, and data requirements across CRM, contact centre, and integration platforms. The environment is complex and federated, spanning multiple states, existing CRM platforms, and diverse stakeholder groups.

Working closely with the Product Owner – Customer Experience, Product Manager, architects, vendors, and state-based teams, you will act as a trusted bridge between service design, human need, and technical delivery.

This is a Fixed Term Contract until the end of June 2027, aligned to a pivotal discovery and delivery phase of the program.

What you’ll lead / do

Elicit and document functional and non-functional requirements, workflows, and business rules across CRM, contact centre and integration platforms
Analyse and document complex data mappings and data flows across multiple state CRM environments
Work closely with vendors and technical teams to translate requirements into clear, testable acceptance criteria
Support discovery and detailed analysis for major upcoming releases, including CRM integration and telephony
Document system integration and user acceptance test cases, and support business users through UAT
Engage sensitively with state-based stakeholders, respecting existing systems, investments, and local context
Operate within an agile delivery environment, applying just-enough documentation and iterative practices
Contribute to a collaborative, psychologically safe program culture grounded in empathy and professionalism

﻿What you’ll bring

5+ years’ experience as a Senior Business Analyst on complex, customer-facing technology programs
Proven experience across CRM platforms, ideally Microsoft Dynamics 365, with Salesforce exposure highly regarded
Practical understanding of system integration, data synchronisation, and data quality challenges
Experience working across contact centre platforms and multi-vendor delivery environments
Confidence operating in federated or matrixed organisations with complex stakeholder landscapes
High emotional intelligence, strong listening skills, and the ability to read a room
A pragmatic, collaborative mindset, willing to step beyond strict role boundaries to help the program succeed
A genuine alignment to purpose and motivation to use technology for social impact

About Cancer Council and the Program

Cancer Council is Australia’s leading cancer charity, a trusted voice, advocate, and lifeline for millions.

The Australian Cancer Nursing and Navigation Program (ACNNP) aims to connect people with cancer to quality care, information, and support services, no matter their cancer type, background, or location.

As part of the ACNNP, Cancer Council will be delivering the National Cancer Navigation Service, enhancing and expanding our cancer information and support service through the creation of a new national cancer navigation service, offering new ways for more people affected by cancer to access support and information that best meets their needs, now and into the future.

This Customer Experience stream will deliver an integrated CRM, contact-centre, and data ecosystem that connects patients, carers, and clinicians to the right support, wherever they are in their cancer journey. It’s technology with humanity at its core, transforming how Australians access care, and how Cancer Council delivers it.
