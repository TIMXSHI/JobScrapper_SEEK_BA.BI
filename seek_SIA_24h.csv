This role will work a 5/2 roster from the Sydney office with some flexibility to WFH Fridays.

We understand that flexible work means something different to everyone and encourage you to have a conversation about the flexible work options available.

About the Role

The Business Partner Planning and Analysis is a high‑profile position within our finance function where your analysis genuinely shapes business decisions. Reporting to the Group Manager Financial Planning and Analysis, you will sit at the centre of our planning rhythms, partnering across sites, corporate teams and senior leadership.

You will support the full planning cycle including long‑term planning, annual budgets, and intra‑year reforecasts. Your work, drawing on at least 2 years mining and resources experience, will help guide performance expectations for the market, including analysis that informs leadership and supports ASX guidance. You will also play a hands‑on role in future system upgrades as we evaluate and implement a new planning tool for the Group.

You understand how operational decisions flow through to financial outcomes and you're comfortable working under time pressure without compromising accuracy. You have enough experience in mining, resources or related industries to understand the rhythm of production and cost drivers, and you're curious enough to keep asking ""why"" until the story behind the data is clear.

You are confident engaging with senior stakeholders and not afraid to present your work. You like being part of system and process improvements and are keen to shape how planning is done across the business. You enjoy being coached and given responsibility and you bring a steady, solutions‑focused approach when things move quickly or change direction.

You'll bring:

Experience in FP&A, commercial analysis or management accounting, ideally with exposure to budgeting, forecasting and modelling
Strong analytical capability and advanced skills in Excel and financial modelling
Experience with planning systems or ERP platforms and an interest in transformation or system uplift
Tertiary qualifications in finance, commerce or a related field (CA or CPA desirable)

Most importantly, you're driven by impact. You want to partner with the business, contribute to meaningful change and grow your career in a role where your work is seen, valued and acted on.

Closing
