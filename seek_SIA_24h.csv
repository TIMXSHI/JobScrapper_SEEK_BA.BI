Build and own the AI engine that powers a fast‑moving wholesale operation – from warehouse floor to sales pipeline – turning messy, manual processes into a single, living “source of truth” that everyone can see, trust and act on.

What you’ll be doing
Audit, map, improve. Spend your first 30 days embedded with sales, operations and logistics, pulling apart workflows, spotting “time leaks” and designing AI‑driven fixes that actually ship, not sit in slide decks.
Build the “Dashboard of Truth.” Design and deploy real‑time dashboards (Power BI/custom) wired into Harmonic ERP so every role has a live scorecard, clear KPIs, and forward‑looking trends instead of rear‑view reports.
Supercharge sales and logistics. Create tools that point sales to the right customers at the right time, and help logistics move high‑volume perishables with maximum speed, minimal waste and fewer surprises.
Tame the wild GPTs. Take DIY AI tools created by managers, and rebuild them into a secure, governed, shared framework using Confluence and centralised AI services – same creativity, less chaos.
Own the wholesale ChatBot. Design, build and continuously train a 24/7 client ChatBot that can answer complex product, availability and logistics questions without losing the human tone the brand is known for.
Be the “Tomorrow Team.” Scan the AI landscape, experiment with new tools, and bring only the ones that move real metrics – efficiency, margin, accuracy, customer experience – into production.
The kind of person this will suit
Fluent in “business” and “code.” You can sit in a sales meeting, hear a vague problem, and translate it into data models, workflows and prompts – then go away and quietly make it real.
Hands‑on builder. Comfortable in Python for AI/automation, SQL for getting clean data out of the ERP, and Power BI (or similar) for turning that into visual narratives teams actually use.
Systems thinker. You see end‑to‑end flows across sales, inventory, operations and finance, and design AI interventions that work across the whole system, not just one screen.
Logistics‑curious. You don’t need flower experience, but high‑volume, time‑sensitive product and the puzzle of getting it to the right client at exactly the right moment genuinely excites you.
High‑energy starter. You like being the first in, building a function almost from scratch, setting standards, and proving value quickly with visible wins.
What’s on offer
Real ownership. This isn’t “internal IT” or “BI reporting.” You’ll architect the AI and data layer that underpins how the entire business sells, buys, moves and serves.
Salary on offer. Circa $100 - $120k + super but open to discussion for the ""AI guru""
Flex that respects adults. Full‑time role with genuine flexibility in hours and location, plus a regular in‑person rhythm: weekly team time and quarterly strategy days in West Leederville.
Strategy seat. You’ll be at the table for quarterly strategy, shaping how AI supports growth, customer experience and operational excellence over the next 3–5 years.
Industry with heart. You’ll be working in an environment built around creativity, relationships and helping floral businesses thrive – with a team that cares about partnership as much as product.
How to know if you should throw your hat in

If you’ve ever looked at a business and thought, “With clean data, a couple of well‑chosen models, and some decent dashboards, this place would run completely differently,” this is your blank canvas.

Tell me (briefly) about one workflow you transformed with data or AI, what it looked like before, what you built, and the measurable shift it created. Then attach your CV and hit apply.

If you have some questions before applying feel free to call me, Andrew (the guy up the top of the ad) on 08 6140 1800 and we can have a confidential chat."

Embed governance standards into integration and analytics delivery by design.
Act as the escalation point for cross-domain data definition and quality disputes.
Translate governance concepts into practical, delivery-friendly guidance.

 

What We’re Looking For

To thrive in this role, you will bring:

Must Have / Non-Negotiable Experience

Senior-level experience in data governance, data quality or enterprise data management.
Deep, hands-on expertise with Informatica, particularly governance and data quality capabilities.
Proven ability to influence senior business and technology stakeholders.
Strong understanding of enterprise data domains (e.g. supplier, product, order, reference).
Strong analytical capability, including SQL.
Ability to balance strategic governance design with hands on execution.

Nice to Have Experience

Salesforce data models or integration experience.
Exposure to Databricks, lakehouse architectures or MDM initiatives.
Familiarity with governance frameworks such as DCAM or DAMA-DMBOK.
Experience implementing data catalogues, lineage or metadata management tooling.

 

What Success Looks Like in 12 Months

After 6-12 months in this role, success will look like:

A governance framework that is operating, adopted and embedded.
Data owners and stewards clearly defined, enabled and accountable.
Visible improvement in data quality KPIs across priority domains.
Trusted, consistent data definitions across Salesforce, MFG and analytics platforms.
A clear single point of accountability for enterprise data governance and quality.

 

What PFD is Offering the Successful Candidate

We are offering competitive remuneration, superannuation and other staff benefits (such as discounts on staff purchases, discounted accommodation, health insurance and banking).
