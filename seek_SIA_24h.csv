We're looking for a Senior Engineer to join the AI Research & Experience team, helping build AI Coach - Culture Amp's contextually-aware AI system that integrates survey insights, performance management, and interpersonal dynamics to deliver personalized support to organizations, teams, and individuals at scale.

You'll work at the intersection of applied AI research and product engineering, translating cutting-edge techniques into production systems that genuinely improve how people experience work. This isn't a research lab - you'll be shipping features that solve real customer problems. 

What you'll do

Staying up to date with current research, literature and provider offerings. 
Design, implement and evaluate areas and features of our multi-agentic platform and systems using modern frameworks (e.g., LangGraph) for stateful, multi-turn coaching conversations.
Advise, help build, and orchestrate data pipelines that unify fragmented workplace data (surveys, goals, performance reviews, feedback, 1-1 notes) into coherent coaching context
Translate customer requirements into technical solutions - working backwards from user needs to system design. Creating technical documentation to support literacy, technical transfer and engineering practice.
Partner closely with product, design, and people science to ensure the features developed are fit for purpose, and in-line with the existing product expectations to ensure seamless partnership transfer of technology.

A pragmatic, solution-focused mindset - you evaluate new technology through the lens of ""does this scalably solve the problem?"" not ""is this technically interesting?""
You fit our values with the proactivity to take risks, and the humility to learn in public. You take pride in your work and its successful utilisation, stability, extendability and maintainability. 

Strong signals:

Experience at startups or founding teams - comfortable with ambiguity and fast iteration

Work closely with a Senior Data architect to align data flow, modelling and best-practice design.
Support and improve reporting from ERP and field service platforms (e.g. Jobpac / construction ERP systems).
Operate effectively in a low-documentation environment, taking ownership of data discovery and structure.
Key Requirements   

Proven experience in a Data Analyst or similar role within complex, operational environments.
Strong hands-on experience with ETL processes and data integration and Advanced SQL skills.
Solid experience with Power BI, including data modelling and semantic layer design.
Experience working with APIs and system integrations.
Strong understanding of data flow, data best practice and analytics enablement.
