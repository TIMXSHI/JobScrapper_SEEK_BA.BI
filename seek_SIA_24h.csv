Growth Product Manager We’re looking for a Growth Product Manager to join a fast-growing, well-funded consumer scale-up that’s reshaping its industry. With over 100,000 active customers, $200M+ in annual revenue, and a valuation heading toward unicorn status, this is a chance to join a company at a pivotal point in its journey. ARR more than doubled last year, and the business is on track for another 60% growth in 2025 - now’s the time to help accelerate that trajectory.

This role is ideal for someone who loves diving deep into data, uncovering insights that shape strategy, and running structured experiments that drive measurable results. You’ll operate at the intersection of product, marketing, data, and design, helping to uncover what truly moves the needle for customers and the business.

What You’ll Be Doing
Own the growth roadmap: Build and execute a clear, prioritised plan across acquisition, activation, conversion and retention.
Lead experimentation: Design and run data-informed experiments at scale, testing hypotheses that influence the customer journey and revenue levers.
Turn insights into strategy: Use data, customer research, and behavioural signals to identify and prioritise high-impact growth opportunities.
Collaborate cross-functionally: Partner with design, engineering, and analytics to deliver fast, evidence-based iterations that improve key metrics.
Balance short-term and long-term impact: Deliver quick wins through testing and optimisation, while shaping the long-term strategy for sustainable growth.
Report on performance: Translate results into actionable insights and communicate clearly with senior stakeholders.
What You’ll Bring
5+ years’ experience in product management or growth within a fast-moving consumer or subscription-based business.
Proven success driving conversion rate improvements, funnel optimisation, and customer retention through experimentation.
A strong analytical mindset, with hands-on experience in data analysis and experimentation tools (SQL, Looker, Amplitude, GA4, etc.).
Commercial acumen - able to connect product decisions to revenue, margin, and customer lifetime value.
Customer empathy - you think deeply about user motivations and behaviours, not just metrics.
Fluency in growth frameworks (AARRR, ICE, Effort/Impact, Opportunity Solution Tree) and comfort with ambiguity.
Strong communication skills - able to distil complex ideas into clear narratives and influence across teams.
Who You Are
A structured thinker who can quickly break down complex problems.
Hands-on and curious - you love running discovery and getting close to the data.
Balanced - you can deliver quick, tactical experiments but also step back to see the strategic picture.
Collaborative - you bring teams along with you, ensuring alignment from concept to execution.
Motivated by impact - you’re driven by seeing your ideas translate into real business and customer outcomes.
Why You’ll Love It

You’ll join a profitable, product-led scaleup that’s transforming its category through data, experimentation and a deep understanding of its customers.
You’ll have genuine ownership, a talented cross-functional team to partner with, and the opportunity to define how growth happens - not just react to it.
