If we do our job well, we genuinely add to the prosperity of our country and its people.

How you'll make an impact

This is a key role in the 'Core team' within the AI Hub supporting the Head Of AI and other team members. As a Senior Business Analyst in the team you will lead analysis, develop insights, together with business requirements, producing materials that help deliver the agreed AI Hub Strategy, Roadmap and OKRs.

You will work closely with the business to lead and shape AI / Generative AI / Agentic AI use cases including conducting cost benefit analysis, conduct user research to define problem / opportunities, work with Product Owners to define user stories and features, support risk and other assessments applicable to AI Lifecycle, and support the development and implementation of Pilots / PoCs as applicable.

For whole-of-enterprise and / or highly novel AI systems you may also work as the Product Owner - making decisions in conjunction with stakeholders (e.g. customers) about features, functionality and other product aspects.



You'll combine deep analytical capability with a collaborative mindset to thrive in this dynamic environment.
