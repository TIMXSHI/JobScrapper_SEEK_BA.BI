Coordinate project activities, dependencies, and timelines to ensure alignment between teams.Help unblock, remove ambiguity, and support smooth project execution.
Drive Technology Enablement: Partner with Finance Systems, Data, and Engineering teams to implement automation, system integrations, and AI-based solutions that streamline end-to-end workflows.
Help shape the Transformation Roadmap: Collaborating with finance and business leaders to define the strategic direction for the Finance Technology stack and transformation priorities.
Data, Insight & Automation: Champion data-driven decision-making - ensuring finance data is leveraged effectively for reporting, analytics, and automation.

Significant experience in Finance Transformation, or Process Improvement roles (experience in fast-scaling tech, SaaS, or global environments strongly preferred).
A background in Finance with a Bachelor's degree in Finance, Accounting, Business Administration, or a related field is a big plus.
Experience with driving process redesign. Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, able to break down ambiguity into actionable steps.
Familiarity with finance ERP, billing and reporting systems (e.g., Workday, Netsuite, Zuora, Salesforce, Anaplan) and an understanding of data and automation and AI platforms.
Proven ability to lead large scale transformation programs end-to-end from strategy and design to implementation and embedding.
