Within the Specialist Business division, we empower our frontline teams, customers, and partners with timely, insightful analysis. You'll be a key player in boosting Bendigo Bank Agribusiness's profile, collaborating closely with sales and our relationship driven frontline teams.

 

It starts here. With Bendigo Bank… and you.

As Senior Manager, Industry Insights, you'll lead our Insights function, driving strategic direction and market leadership. You'll build key relationships with customers, industry bodies, and government, generating valuable primary market intelligence.

This is a high-impact role, shaping our brand, informing our ESG strategy, and boosting revenue from our agri-insights business. You’ll mentor a high-performing team of Analysts, delivering cutting edge insights to internal and external stakeholders. Ready to make a difference?

 

In this dynamic and influential role, you’ll make your mark with:

Thought Leadership & External Engagement: Establish Bendigo Bank as a leading voice in the agricultural sector through media engagement, industry events, and networking.

Cultivating a High-Performing Team: The role demands fostering a positive, high-performing team culture aligned with Bendigo Bank's values, encouraging thought leadership, and providing coaching and development opportunities for team members.
Strategic Leadership: Collaborating with the Head of Insights and Government Services on shaping team strategy, overseeing the quality and relevance of insights products, and optimising team processes and tools for maximum effectiveness.
Delivering Balanced Outcomes: Managing the Insights team to achieve both financial targets (revenue) and non-financial goals (e.g., brand building, internal knowledge sharing). A key aspect is balancing internal and external activities.

 

What you’ll bring to the role

To succeed in this role, you will have:

Experience in providing valuable market or channel insights that inform business strategy.
Strong strategic & analytical skills to identify key insights, portfolio management skills to balance competing priorities, and the ability to design and adapt customer value propositions.
Exceptional communication & stakeholder management skills. This encompasses strong media relations, stakeholder engagement, and the ability to clearly communicate complex insights to diverse audiences.

Self-motivation, strong organisational skills and attention to detail are also critical to support in the effective management of concurrent complex projects.
A tertiary qualification in Commerce, Economics or Agriculture is essential.

Want big impact that matters? Here, you’ll know your work directly benefits the customers and communities we all serve.
Want to be more than just a number? Join a team that truly values you – and that gets more and more diverse, every day.
