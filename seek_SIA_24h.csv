Proven experience influencing leadership and coaching non-technical teams through change.

Strong communication, presentation, and interpersonal skills.

Excellent analytical and problem-solving abilities.

Experience in project management and delivering results-oriented communication initiatives.

Minimum 10 years’ experience in a dynamic, adaptive corporate environment.
