Translate underwriting decisioning into API-driven rules and workflows

Improve the overall broker experience

Act as a senior bridge between business and technology in a highly data- and logic-driven environment




What You’ll Bring

Essential

Strong insurance industry background, ideally within underwriting or product (not claims-led)

Proven understanding of underwriting language

Extensive experience as a Senior Business Analyst on complex transformation programs

Confidence working directly with underwriters and translating their intent into structured logic

Experience working with APIs, integrations and modern digital platforms

Highly analytical mindset with a focus on decisioning, data and customer outcomes

Nice to Have

Experience working with business rules engines or decision management platforms

SME or commercial insurance exposure

Experience modernising or replacing legacy insurance systems




Why This Role?

Complex, high-impact BA role focused on underwriting logic and decisioning

Opportunity to materially improve broker experience through better context and automation

Greenfield rules capability within a large insurance environment

12-month contract offering stability and depth of engagement




If you’re an insurance-experienced Senior Business Analyst who enjoys turning complex underwriting logic into clear, automated outcomes, we’d love to hear from you.
