AIHW are seeking to fill two roles:

- Group Head – Population Health Group SES Band 1; and

- Group Head – Housing and Specialised Services Group, SES Band 1.

The AIHW has recently established 3 divisions - the Health Insights Division, Community and First Nations Insights Division and the Corporate Strategy and Performance Division. Currently, Group Head vacancies exist in the Health Insights Division (for the Population Health Group), and the Community and First Nations Insights Division (for the Housing and Specialised Services Group). Both these roles report to Executive Directors (SES Band 2) and form part of the institute’s senior leadership team.

The Population Health Group comprises several units covering burden of disease, cancer, chronic conditions, preventive health and injuries. The group collects, compiles, analyses and presents comprehensive data about the health of Australians. The group has a particular role to play in expanding the amount of evidence available, particularly in relation to cancer and linkage across domains such as aged care and disability.

The Housing and Specialised Services Group comprises several units that collect and analyse data to support reporting and policy decisions on the health and welfare of Australians. The Group has a particular focus on specialised services including housing, veterans supports, drug and alcohol supports, child protection systems, youth justice systems and correctional facilities.

To be a strong contender for either of these important roles you will have experience leading data management, analytical, reporting and/or statistical functions and have a strong working understanding of the Australian health and welfare landscape.
