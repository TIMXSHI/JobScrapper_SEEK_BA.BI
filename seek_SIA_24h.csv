Hybrid | 3 days p/w on site | Melbourne | Day rate | Parking nearby

This is not a purely strategic or advisory governance role. It’s a hands-on position for someone who enjoys getting into messy data, asking the hard questions, and working closely with the business to fix real problems.
If you’re the kind of person who likes understanding why data is broken, explaining it clearly to non-technical teams, and then helping put the fix in place — this role will suit you.

What you’ll be doing
This role is approximately 50/50 hands-on delivery and stakeholder engagement.

You will:

Monitor, track and report on data quality metrics and issues
Conduct root cause analysis on data issues and recommend practical remediation actions
Work with business teams to clean up data and prevent repeat issues
Define, document and maintain data definitions, metadata and business glossaries
Build and maintain Power BI dashboards and regular operational reporting
Use advanced Excel and SQL daily (some scripting/coding experience is highly desirable)
Support the development of data standards, governance processes and roadmaps
Work closely with delivery teams on a high-profile billing program
What the hiring team is really looking for
They are prioritising communication and mindset just as much as technical capability.

You’ll be successful if you:

Can confidently explain Data Governance to people who don’t work in data
Can explain metadata and data quality issues in plain English
Are comfortable having frequent conversations across the business 
Are inquisitive, ask “why”, and dig deeper into issues
Can work independently once given direction (no hand-holding)
Stay positive and solutions-focused in complex, high-pressure environments
Essential experience
Hands-on experience implementing or operating data governance practices
Strong experience with data quality monitoring, reporting and issue management
Proven root cause analysis experience on data issues
Metadata management, data definitions, business glossaries and documentation
Advanced Excel, strong SQL, and Power BI dashboarding
Experience working with billing, customer, financial or transactional data
Strong stakeholder engagement and communication skills
Experience working in utilities, financial services, government or large enterprise environments
Highly regarded
Certification in Data Governance or Data Management (e.g. CDMP, CDPSE, DCAM)
Experience stepping into “fix it” roles where things are already live and imperfect
Why this role?
You’ll have real ownership and impact
You’ll work with a passionate, collaborative data leader who values open communication
You’ll help stabilise and improve a critical billing and customer data environment
This is a role for someone who wants to add value quickly, not sit on the sidelines
If this sounds like you, apply now or reach out to me at Lfrank@launchrecruitment.com.au for a confidential conversation.

If you’re more strategy-focused or prefer minimal stakeholder interaction, this role is unlikely to be the right fit — and that’s completely okay."
