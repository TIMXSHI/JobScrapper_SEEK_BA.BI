We’re looking for a Head of Digital Marketing to take ownership of one of Australia’s largest, most recognisable large-scale campaigns and drive its next phase of growth.
This is a senior, hands-on role for someone who lives and breathes digital marketing, performance, optimisation and engagement. The campaign is powered primarily through sophisticated EDM programs and lifecycle marketing, supported by broader ATL and BTL activity. Your mandate is clear: increase participation, deepen engagement, optimise performance and grow revenue.

You’ll sit at the intersection of strategy and execution. While you’ll set the direction and lead a capable team, this is not a purely advisory role. You’ll stay close to the tools, the data and the detail, particularly during peak campaign periods.
If you thrive in fast-paced, campaign-driven environments and are energised by scale, complexity and measurable outcomes, this is a genuinely rare opportunity.

What You’ll Lead In this senior, specialist role, you will:

Own the end-to-end digital marketing and growth strategy for a large-scale national campaign, spanning both Above the Line and Below the Line activity.
Lead the supporter and participant journey, with a strong focus on EDMs, lifecycle marketing, segmentation, testing and conversion optimisation.
Drive engagement and revenue growth through data-led decision making, continuous optimisation and performance marketing best practice.
Remain hands-on across key platforms including Campaign Monitor, Mailchimp, Iterable, Google Analytics and PowerBI.
Translate complex performance data into clear insights that inform strategy, prioritisation and investment decisions.
Lead and develop a high-performing team, including a Marketing 2IC overseeing email, lifecycle and conversion specialists.
Systemise and scale marketing operations to ensure the team performs under pressure during peak campaign cycles.
Partner closely with senior leadership and cross-functional teams to align marketing activity with commercial and growth objectives.
Bring new ideas, technologies and approaches to the table to continually lift performance and keep the campaign ahead of the curve.
About You You’re a digitally fluent marketing leader who combines strategic thinking with deep technical capability. You’re as comfortable in PowerBI and GA as you are shaping a campaign narrative or coaching a team.

You’ll be well suited to this role if you:

Have 8+ years’ experience in digital marketing, growth or performance-led marketing roles.
Are highly experienced in EDM-driven campaigns, lifecycle marketing and conversion optimisation at scale.
Have hands-on experience with Campaign Monitor, Mailchimp, Iterable, Google Analytics and PowerBI.
Understand how to balance ATL brand activity with BTL performance channels.
Are commercially minded and motivated by measurable outcomes, engagement metrics and revenue growth.
Can confidently lead, mentor and develop specialists while staying close to execution yourself.
Thrive in fast-paced, deadline-driven environments, particularly during major campaign periods.
Care deeply about building strong systems, processes and team capability.
What’s On Offer
A senior leadership role with real ownership and influence over a nationally recognised campaign.
The opportunity to drive large-scale engagement and revenue through sophisticated digital marketing.
Close collaboration with executive leadership and direct input into growth strategy.
A high-calibre team and the chance to mentor a strong Marketing 2IC.
A dynamic, ambitious culture that values innovation, performance and accountability.
