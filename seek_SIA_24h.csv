Do you want a career that means more? At Anglicare Sydney, we bring the strength, the support and the strategy to make it happen. We're a well-respected not-for-profit that's been serving society's most vulnerable for more than 160 years. Each year, we achieve life-changing outcomes for the 40,000+ people who rely on our person-centred support. And now, we're extending our reach and impact even further.

The rapid acceleration of data, digital and AI across Anglicare is mission critical to revolutionising how we serve our diverse and vulnerable communities. This role is for a commercial, highly strategic self-starter who can translate complexity into direction, build alignment across stakeholders, and help the organisation focus on what matters most.

Your opportunity

Reporting to the GM, Data & Digital, you'll act as a strategic ""engine room"" across the Digital & Data portfolio - a high-trust, high-impact role that brings structure, momentum and commercial sharpness to a fast-moving environment.

You'll take complex inputs from meetings, projects and stakeholders, connect the dots, and turn them into crisp executive-ready outputs that drive decisions and delivery. You'll also help create a consistent operating rhythm across initiatives - clarifying priorities, sequencing, governance and ways of working.

With integrity and resilience, you will:

Translate Digital & Data strategy into tangible artefacts:roadmaps, playbooks, governance rhythms, role clarity and decision pathways
Maintain a ""single source of truth"" across priorities, interdependencies and ways of working
Build and refine business cases, investment decks and strategic documents, including benefits, costs, risks and delivery approaches
Develop pragmatic sizing (ranges/scenarios/confidence levels) for value, effort and risk - with clear assumptions
Produce compelling executive materials (slides, memos, one-pagers) that drive clarity, consensus and action
Design and support executive/SBU sessions to align on priorities, trade-offs and sequencing
Create mechanisms that make engagement with Digital & Data easy: intake patterns, prioritisation forums and comms cadences
Partner across DigiTech, Finance, Strategy and SBUs to enable end-to-end outcomes and consistent narratives

What you'll bring

You're equal parts strategic, commercial and polished - someone who can move between ambiguity and action, and who's trusted to represent priorities clearly across senior stakeholders.

You'll likely bring:

A relevant degree (e.g., Commerce, Business Analytics, Computer Science or the Arts with relevant business experience)
3+ years in management consulting (strategy / operating model / transformation / digital advisory) within 5+ years broader experience
Demonstrated ability to produce executive-grade documentation (especially PowerPoint) and influence decisions
Strong commercial and analytical capability - benefits sizing, investment logic, options analysis, structured problem solving
The ability to turn complexity into crisp narratives: ""why this, why now, what changes, how we'll measure it""
Confidence building pragmatic financial models and value cases (you don't need to be deeply technical)
Comfort with modern tooling for analysis and storytelling (Excel and PowerPoint is a must and Databricks/PowerBI /Canva/Figma a plus)
A collaborative influencing style - aligning people through clarity and story, not authority

Desirable (but not essential):

Digital/product exposure (discovery, agile delivery, service design)
Data/analytics/AI-adjacent strategy experience, portfolio governance and value tracking
Experience in complex service organisations (health, aged care, government, regulated environments)

Why Anglicare Sydney?

This is a chance to do genuinely meaningful work - and to have outsized impact in a role that shapes how a leading social impact organisation navigates change and opportunity. You'll be welcomed into a compassionate, respectful and purpose-driven community where we don't just talk about values - we live them.

At Anglicare, you'll get the security and stability of a strong, well-established organisation that's ready for the future - while working in a space (Digital, Data & AI) that's evolving quickly and creating new possibilities for mission impact.

This is not a traditional sales role, and it’s not a delivery lead position. It’s a shaping role, focused on identifying early stage opportunities, navigating ambiguity, and selling integrated, outcome-led solutions rather than point platforms.

What you’ll do:

• Shape loosely defined opportunities into funded engagements
• Lead consultative client conversations and discovery workshops
• Sell business outcomes (CX, transformation, operating model) — not products
• Orchestrate cross-capability solutions across strategy, technology and delivery
• Convert diagnostics and early-stage engagements into material downstream work

What we’re looking for:


Strong consulting background with delivery, credibility
Experience selling complex services engagements
Enough technical depth to be credible in senior conversations
Commercially astute, outcome-focused and comfortable operating at Director level
Ideally some Salesforce experience.
If you thrive in ambiguity, enjoy shaping demand upstream, and want to influence how integrated consulting solutions are taken to market, this is a standout opportunity."
