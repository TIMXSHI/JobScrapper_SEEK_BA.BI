Architect, develop, and optimise scalable data pipelines, lakehouse architectures, and reusable data products.
Lead complex legacy-to-cloud data migrations, including reverse engineering ETL jobs, stored procedures, and reporting logic, and re-engineering them for performance, automation, and maintainability.
Design and implement enterprise-grade data models and semantic layers to support analytics, operational reporting, and future machine learning use cases.
Ensure migrated and redesigned data assets are fully reconciled, validated, and fit for business consumption.
Enable self-service analytics through well-curated, trusted datasets and Power BI semantic models.
Implement CI/CD and DevOps practices to automate data ingestion, transformation, testing, and deployment.
Enforce data governance, quality, security, and documentation standards across the data platform.
Conduct data discovery and profiling of legacy and source systems to identify quality issues, gaps, risks, and ownership responsibilities.
Develop and maintain source-to-target data mappings and support ETL processes using Databricks, SQL, and related technologies.
Execute mock migrations, reconciliations, and validations across Dev, SIT, and UAT environments, documenting and resolving defects.
Collaborate with business SMEs, analysts, and product owners to translate requirements into scalable, sustainable solutions.
Provide technical oversight, assurance, and quality review of vendor-delivered solutions.
