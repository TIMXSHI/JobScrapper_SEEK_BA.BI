A team who values real diversity and inclusion, in a big brand with big ambitions.

What you'll be doing

As the Lead Business Analyst, Planning & Delivery, you’ll be the bridge between technology and business strategy — helping shape how we plan, prioritise, and deliver technology initiatives across the organisation. You’ll orchestrate annual and quarterly planning cycles that align technology investments with organisational objectives, combining analytical rigour with strategic thinking to ensure resources are allocated where they create the most value.

It’s an exciting opportunity for someone who thrives in this environment and isn’t afraid to roll up their sleeves to make things happen.

We’re not looking for someone who just knows the theory — we want a hands-on doer who’s happy to dive in, figure things out, and continuously improve as we go.

Key Responsibilities

Strategic planning: Lead annual and quarterly technology planning cycles, aligning priorities with strategic objectives and organisational goals.
Stakeholder engagement: Partner with Technology, Finance, Delivery and Executive teams to gather insights, surface dependencies, and influence decision-making.
Governance and process improvement: Design, test, and refine planning frameworks, tools, and planning governance processes that balance flexibility with accountability.
Portfolio insight: Work with the Manager, Reporting & Governance to maintain visibility across the technology portfolio, track progress and dependencies, and provide data-driven analysis to support trade-off decisions.
Continuous improvement: Identify opportunities to enhance planning efficiency, delivery velocity, and transparency across the technology function.

You’ll be great in this role if you have…

A relevant degree and 5+ years’ experience in business analysis, strategic planning, or management consulting
Proven experience leading enterprise-level planning or portfolio processes
Exceptional communication and influencing skills, with confidence presenting to Leadership
The drive to get things done — you’re proactive, adaptable, and not afraid to take ownership in an unstructured environment

What you'll be doing

As the Lead Business Analyst, Planning & Delivery, you’ll be the bridge between technology and business strategy — helping shape how we plan, prioritise, and deliver technology initiatives across the organisation.

It’s an exciting opportunity for someone who thrives in this environment and isn’t afraid to roll up their sleeves to make things happen.

We’re not looking for someone who just knows the theory — we want a hands-on doer who’s happy to dive in, figure things out, and continuously improve as we go.

Strategic planning: Lead annual and quarterly technology planning cycles, aligning priorities with strategic objectives and organisational goals.
Stakeholder engagement: Partner with Technology, Finance, Delivery and Executive teams to gather insights, surface dependencies, and influence decision-making.

Portfolio insight: Work with the Manager, Reporting & Governance to maintain visibility across the technology portfolio, track progress and dependencies, and provide data-driven analysis to support trade-off decisions.
Continuous improvement: Identify opportunities to enhance planning efficiency, delivery velocity, and transparency across the technology function.
Build from scratch: Establish foundational processes, templates, and routines that will mature as the function grows — you’ll be shaping how this capability operates for years to come.

You’ll be great in this role if you have…

A relevant degree and 5+ years’ experience in business analysis, strategic planning, or management consulting
Proven experience leading enterprise-level planning or portfolio processes
Exceptional communication and influencing skills, with confidence presenting to Leadership
The drive to get things done — you’re proactive, adaptable, and not afraid to take ownership in an unstructured environment
Strong analytical capability and planning acumen, with a talent for turning data into insights
Proficiency in financial modelling, data analysis, and business intelligence tools
A solid understanding of technology delivery and governance framework

For this role you’ll  ideally be based at our Brisbane HQ ,though we also have a Sydney office and welcome applicants based there who are open to travel between locations.

We’re committed to looking after you, with some of the best benefits and conditions in the industry – including (but not limited to):

Flexible Hybrid working arrangements (*This will take effect after the training period)
Discounted flights for you and your loved ones (including $1000 worth of travel credits per year)
Discounts on travel insurance, lounge membership, car hire, accommodation, and experiences worldwide
Cheaper hospitality, retail, technology, beauty, and wellness services
Free counselling and access to a wellbeing app to support your physical, mental, social and financial health
