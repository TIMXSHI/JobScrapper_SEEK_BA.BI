Lead and develop a team of 3–4 experienced professionals
About You

You’re a seasoned risk leader who combines strategic oversight with hands-on capability. You understand the technical, regulatory, and ethical dimensions of AI and data — and are passionate about enabling innovation safely.

You’ll bring:

12+ years’ experience in Technology or Security Risk Management, ideally in financial services.
Proven experience leading AI and Data Risk frameworks across multiple jurisdictions (UK, EU, India, Australia, HK).
Deep understanding of AI governance, algorithmic risk, bias, and responsible AI model development.
Knowledge of cross-border data privacy and global regulatory frameworks (GDPR, DORA, APRA, FCA, PRA, HKMA).
Qualifications in IT, Computer Science, or Information Security (postgraduate desirable).
Certifications such as CRISC, CISM, CISA, CISSP, ISO 27001/42001 Lead Auditor are advantageous.
Exceptional stakeholder engagement, leadership, and influencing skills — able to operate both strategically and tactically.

The opportunity to directly influence business decisions and contribute to operational efficiency.
A permanent position with a competitive salary.
The chance to work with a market leader in a growing industry.
