Take on a key role in a significant redevelopment of this system that requires strong C++ and software design capability
Join a collaborative group that values curiosity, problem solving, and thoughtful engineering



The opportunity to join our team

We are looking for a Senior Analyst Engineer who enjoys solving complex problems, thrives in environments with uncertainty, and is ready for a new challenge. This team owns a proprietary system that is central to the business, and we are responsible for its end-to-end development, ongoing support, and continuous modernisation. A major focus over the coming period is a significant redevelopment of this system. This work involves architectural redesign, complex problem solving, and deep C++ engineering.

In this role you will work across development, production support, testing, and broader IT tasks, with the balance of work evolving over time based on system needs and team priorities. Flexibility, openness, and curiosity are key.

This is a great opportunity for someone who wants to apply their senior level software engineering expertise, contribute to a major area of system development, and play an influential role within a highly collaborative team.

What you will be doing
In this role you will work across a mix of development, support, and system improvement activities, contributing to both day to day outcomes and longer term engineering uplift.

Designing, developing, and delivering changes to business-critical systems using C++ and modern software design principles
Playing a central role in the upcoming system redevelopment, including rearchitecting components and solving complex technical challenges
Working closely with architects, delivery leads, technical specialists, and business partners to shape and implement quality solutions
Supporting production environments on a rotating roster to maintain system reliability and availability

Uplifting system capability and engineering practices across the team
Providing informal mentoring by sharing your technical strengths, explaining your reasoning clearly, and influencing decision making in positive ways
Helping shape a constructive, energetic, and supportive team culture

What You Bring to This Role
We are looking for someone who brings strong engineering capability, a positive mindset, and the confidence to operate in evolving and sometimes uncertain technical environments.

Strong C++ software development experience (ideally 8 or more years, but we are flexible for the right capability)
Strong software design skills and experience working in complex systems
Comfortable operating in technical ambiguity and taking ownership in uncertain situations
Someone who wants variety in their work and is open to the mix of responsibilities evolving over time
A proactive approach to problem solving with the ability to work independently when required
Clear communication skills and the ability to explain technical decisions in a way that helps others learn
A positive influence who brings energy, patience, and a willingness to help the team grow
Experience across cloud environments, DevOps practices, Linux, SQL, or scripting is beneficial but not required
