1. Identify a current issue in financial markets that could benefit from deeper analysis. How might this enhance the RBA’s policy or operational effectiveness? Briefly outline a research question that targets this issue and describe your approach to answering it.

2. Describe your style of collaboration using past examples. Why do you think it is effective? Share a lesson that you have learned about collaboration from feedback or a mistake. If possible, include examples where you took responsibility for delivery and worked across teams.

3. The Research and Modelling Hub is a collaborative and analytical team within the RBA. What kind of culture do you think the Hub should aim for and why? As an analyst in the team, how would you support this culture?

Permanent role with flexible working arrangements

About the team

Financial Markets Group (FMG) is responsible for implementing operations in domestic and foreign exchange markets, conducting research and analysis on developments in financial markets and coordinating relationships with international institutions.

FMG is creating a new Financial Markets Research and Modelling Hub as part of its strategy to deepen FMG’s research and modelling capabilities, particularly with respect to the analysis of financial market conditions, exchange rates and capital flows, central bank balance sheet and policy implementation frameworks. The new Hub will work closely with other sections with FMG as well as key internal and external stakeholders to deliver policy relevant research and analytical outputs in a timely manner.

About the role

This is an exciting opportunity to work with the Hub’s senior managers and broader FMG management to establish and operate the research and modelling hub. The role combines technical research work, mentoring and supervision, collaboration and co-ordination across the RBA, and responsibility for promoting an open and dynamic research culture.

About you

We’re seeking candidates who bring a broad set of research, collaboration and leadership skills to support the success of the Hub.

To see success in this role, you will demonstrate in your application:

Essential

Energy, interest, and capability for research that is rigorous and policy-focussed in the area of financial markets.

Advanced technical skills (such as in one or more areas of statistics or modelling) relevant to the analysis of financial markets in the context of central banking. Includes postgraduate qualifications in economics or finance (or equivalent experience) and coding experience.

Ability to communicate technical work to a range of technical and non-technical audiences.

Capability to collaborate effectively in research contexts, including harnessing diverse perspectives and strengths, supporting high-trust working relationships that foster constructive and respectful challenge, mentoring junior collaborators, and effectively leading projects through to delivery.

Ability to foster an open and dynamic team and department culture that models behaviours aligned with the Bank’s values of public interest, integrity, excellence, intelligent inquiry, and respect. A commitment to promoting a sense of inclusion, diversity, and belonging among staff.

Track record of self-driven learning, especially when working outside of own subject matter expertise.

Desirable

Subject matter expertise in financial markets, especially as relevant to the role of central banks.

Experience in a policymaking institution or think-tank.

PhD qualifications.

A track record of success in formal leadership roles, especially if in a research context.

Strong capability and enthusiasm to coordinate research and analysis work across the Financial Markets Group.

Next Steps

To apply for this role, candidates should submit their resume and provide written responses to the following short answer questions (maximum of 250 words per question). As there is no cover letter, candidates should ensure their resume addresses the role requirements.

The short answer questions:

1. Identify a current issue in financial markets that could benefit from deeper analysis. How might this enhance the RBA’s policy or operational effectiveness? Briefly outline a research question that targets this issue and describe your approach to answering it.

2. Describe your style of mentoring and leadership using past examples. Why do you think it is effective? Share a lesson that you have learned about mentoring or leadership from feedback or a mistake.

3. The Research and Modelling Hub is a collaborative and analytical team within the RBA. What kind of culture do you think the Hub should aim for and why? As a manager in the team, how will you support this culture?

Candidates proceeding to interview stage will be given the central line of questioning well in advance.
