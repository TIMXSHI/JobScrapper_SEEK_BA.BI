OnTalent is proud to partner with CS Energy to appoint a curious and commercially astute finance professional to the pivotal role of Budgeting & Forecasting Manager. This position represents a rare opportunity to elevate forecast narratives and strengthen the bridge between data, process, and people across one of Queensland’s most critical energy providers.

As Budgeting & Forecasting Manager, you will play a central role in shaping the organisation’s financial planning capability, leading the delivery of consolidated budgets, forecasts, and insights that guide both strategic and operational decisions. Beyond the numbers, your work will help CS Energy tell the story of its performance, translating data into meaningful insights that inform and influence leaders, stakeholders, and government partners.

Reporting to the Head of Enterprise Planning, Reporting & Analysis, this is a hands-on leadership role responsible for simplifying financial processes, improving data quality, and increasing the usability and value of budget information across the organisation. You will guide a capable team and empower them to own the process, while you focus on driving clarity, connection, and confidence in the organisation’s financial narrative.

Key Responsibilities

• Lead the end-to-end delivery of CS Energy’s consolidated budgets and forecasts, ensuring alignment across operations and corporate divisions while driving continuous improvement in processes, tools, and governance.

• Provide scenario, sensitivity, and re-forecast modelling to support strategic decision-making for the Head of Enterprise Planning, Reporting & Analysis, the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), and the Board.

• Oversee statutory and government submissions including the financials for the State Budget Paper 3, Tridata, the Statement of Corporate Intent, Corporate Plans, and Australian Bureau of Statistics reporting.

• Coordinate joint venture and capital budgeting processes, delivering accurate and timely reporting, analysis, and insights that inform investment and expenditure decisions.

• Strengthen the connection between budgeting and accounting functions and the business, ensuring compliance with financial policies and standards, supporting asset valuations and impairment modelling, and providing leadership in policy updates and board paper preparation.

• Lead the preparation of financial reports and presentations for senior stakeholders, including Board budget challenge and review packs, Treasury submissions, and variance analyses.

About You

You are a naturally curious finance leader who thrives on uncovering insights that make a difference. You have a strong analytical foundation, yet you’re driven by a desire to understand the story behind the numbers — how financial outcomes connect to purpose, strategy, and people. You combine commercial acumen with exceptional relational and communication skills, building trust and understanding across teams to help others see the meaning and impact of their financial decisions and facilitate engagement on enhancing financial outcomes for the business.

With experience in large and complex organisations, including within government-owned or regulated environments, you bring a thoughtful balance of process discipline, analytical rigour and strategic insights. You take pride in mentoring others, developing high-performing teams, and fostering curiosity and confidence within the budgeting function. Technically, you bring advanced financial modelling and analytical skills, and are proficient in tools such as Excel, Power BI, SQL, and SAP. Most importantly, you’re an engaging storyteller who can distil complexity into clarity, influence decisions, and align financial insight with CS Energy’s broader purpose — to deliver affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for Queenslanders.

Why join CS Energy

CS Energy is a proudly Queensland-owned energy company playing a leading role in the state’s energy transition. Its purpose—‘delivering energy today, powering your tomorrow’—reflects a dual commitment to performance and purpose. This role offers the chance to make tangible impact by enhancing the visibility, confidence, and connection between finance and the business, while supporting Queensland’s evolving energy landscape.

You will join a collaborative, forward-thinking finance leadership team that values curiosity, authenticity, and continuous improvement. In return, you’ll be empowered to shape a function that delivers insight, innovation, and measurable value.
