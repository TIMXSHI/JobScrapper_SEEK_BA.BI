We’re Virgin Australia. We’re the airline that’s always done things a little different. Our way. The Virgin way. We’re on a mission to make flying better than ‘nice’. And to do that, it takes a team of talented people who are passionate about customer experience, doing the right thing always, with a focus on safety – in the air, on the ground and in our workplaces. A team who values real diversity and inclusion, in a big brand with big ambitions.

What you'll be doing

As the Lead Business Analyst, Planning & Delivery, you’ll be the bridge between technology and business strategy — helping shape how we plan, prioritise, and deliver technology initiatives across the organisation. You’ll orchestrate annual and quarterly planning cycles that align technology investments with organisational objectives, combining analytical rigour with strategic thinking to ensure resources are allocated where they create the most value.

This is a new and evolving role — there’s no established process (yet). You’ll play a key part in building, testing, and refining how we plan and track technology delivery. It’s an exciting opportunity for someone who thrives in this environment and isn’t afraid to roll up their sleeves to make things happen.

We’re not looking for someone who just knows the theory — we want a hands-on doer who’s happy to dive in, figure things out, and continuously improve as we go.

Key Responsibilities

Strategic planning: Lead annual and quarterly technology planning cycles, aligning priorities with strategic objectives and organisational goals.
Stakeholder engagement: Partner with Technology, Finance, Delivery and Executive teams to gather insights, surface dependencies, and influence decision-making.
Governance and process improvement: Design, test, and refine planning frameworks, tools, and planning governance processes that balance flexibility with accountability.
Portfolio insight: Work with the Manager, Reporting & Governance to maintain visibility across the technology portfolio, track progress and dependencies, and provide data-driven analysis to support trade-off decisions.
Continuous improvement: Identify opportunities to enhance planning efficiency, delivery velocity, and transparency across the technology function.
Build from scratch: Establish foundational processes, templates, and routines that will mature as the function grows — you’ll be shaping how this capability operates for years to come.

You’ll be great in this role if you have…

A relevant degree and 5+ years’ experience in business analysis, strategic planning, or management consulting
Proven experience leading enterprise-level planning or portfolio processes
Exceptional communication and influencing skills, with confidence presenting to Leadership
The drive to get things done — you’re proactive, adaptable, and not afraid to take ownership in an unstructured environment
Strong analytical capability and planning acumen, with a talent for turning data into insights
Proficiency in financial modelling, data analysis, and business intelligence tools
A solid understanding of technology delivery and governance framework

For this role you’ll  ideally be based at our Brisbane HQ ,though we also have a Sydney office and welcome applicants based there who are open to travel between locations.

We’re committed to looking after you, with some of the best benefits and conditions in the industry – including (but not limited to):

Flexible Hybrid working arrangements (*This will take effect after the training period)
Discounted flights for you and your loved ones (including $1000 worth of travel credits per year)
Discounts on travel insurance, lounge membership, car hire, accommodation, and experiences worldwide
Cheaper hospitality, retail, technology, beauty, and wellness services
Free counselling and access to a wellbeing app to support your physical, mental, social and financial health
Dress for Your Day’ – enjoy the freedom to wear whatever makes you feel great for the type of work you do and the day you have ahead of you.
One of Brisbane’s most admired head office locations, with South Bank train station, a supermarket, pharmacy, and lunch options downstairs plus a 5-minute walk to the Busway, a rooftop restaurant and onsite gym (with a low membership fee) and South Bank Parklands just across the road

When everyone is included, everyone wins

We’re all individuals. And we love that. That’s why we encourage applications from Indigenous Australians, people with disability, those from diverse cultural backgrounds, our friends in the LGBTQI+ community, and anyone else who wants to join our family.
