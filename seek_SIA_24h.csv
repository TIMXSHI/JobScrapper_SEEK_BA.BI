Job Description

The Role

We’re looking for a Principal Data Scientist to set the technical direction for how we build end-to-end, data-driven products that create tangible value for hirers and job seekers. In this role, you’ll lead the design of the inference and decisioning layers across our most critical AI/ML products, shaping how SEEK understands supply and demand dynamics in the marketplace and informing high‑impact decisions across the business. You will be a force multiplier: developing technical strategy, uplifting standards and practices across multiple teams, and partnering closely with Product, Engineering, Strategy, and Commercial leaders to deliver measurable business outcomes.

You thrive in a complex, fast-moving environment and operate comfortably across ambiguity, aligning stakeholders on direction, navigating dependencies, shaping estimation and delivery plans, and communicating trade-offs clearly. You remain hands-on where it matters—diving deep into models, methods, and data quality—while cultivating a culture of continuous learning and scientific rigor across the Data Science community.

On any given day, you might:

Evaluate and guide the development of statistically sound, pragmatic models and decision systems, balancing performance, risk, and operational constraints.

Prototype and assess new approaches to unlock step-change improvements on core business problems, and articulate the value, assumptions, and limitations to senior stakeholders.

Collaborate with an Experimentation team to design, instrument, and interpret A/B and quasi-experiments; set best practices for causal inference and robust measurement.

Mentor and sponsor data scientists — reviewing methodologies, validating outputs, and raising standards for reliability, scalability, and ethical use.

Shape and guide end-to-end AI/ML solutions with Engineering and Product—spanning data readiness, simplicity, feature pipelines, model lifecycle, observability, and governance.

Your closest collaborators will include senior peers across the Data Science stream, stream leads who bring Data Science, Engineering, and Product perspectives to joint problem-solving, and squad leads driving contributions across SEEK’s broader AI initiatives. You will also influence cross-stream forums to ensure coherence in technical approaches and reuse of foundational capabilities.

Key Responsibilities

Define and evolve the technical strategy for a focus area (e.g., pricing, market position, ad performance), ensuring data and modelling work directly serve business outcomes and risk thresholds.

Build a deep understanding of SEEK’s data assets and systems and champion the data quality, observability, and documentation required for robust decisioning at scale.

Translate ambiguous, high-value business problems into actionable requirements, clarifying value, assumptions, and constraints; drive alignment on approach and success measures.

Establish and uphold modelling and experimentation standards (evaluation protocols, causal inference patterns, offline/online validation, guardrails) across multiple squads.

Provide technical leadership and coaching to data scientists and leads; review solution designs and code where appropriate; foster a culture of scientific rigor, safety, and learning.

Partner on roadmaps and OKRs, influencing prioritisation and sequencing across teams; balance exploration with reliability and scale in production environments.

Communicate complex concepts to a wide range of audiences—executives, Product, Engineering, and other functions—tailoring depth and framing to drive clear decisions.

Qualifications

Qualifications

Extensive (typically 10+ years) commercial experience building and evolving data-driven products, with deep, hands-on expertise in machine learning algorithms, decision systems, and model performance tuning at scale.

Proven track record operating as a bridge across Data Science, Product, Architecture, and Engineering, solving complex commercial problems and influencing strategy.

Experience leading through influence across multiple teams or managing a high-performing team of Data Scientists; delivery of large, complex, multi-stakeholder initiatives.

High proficiency with Python, SQL, and Spark for data extraction and processing; strong fluency with modern software practices and tooling (e.g., Git, AWS, Databricks, MLflow or equivalents).

Exceptional communication and stakeholder influence skills; ability to operate confidently amid ambiguity, set direction, and drive alignment across functions.

Comfortable in a *nix command-line environment; postgraduate qualification in a quantitative discipline (e.g., Physics, Mathematics, Bioinformatics, Computer Science, Engineering) or equivalent industry experience.

Additional Information

Permanent Perks
At SEEK we offer:

Annual Performance Bonus Plan
Support of flexible working, including a mix of office and work from home days depending on your role.
