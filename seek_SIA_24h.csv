Own the numbers that shape how a high-growth tech company scales.
 
In a nutshell
This is a senior, hands-on role for a data analyst who cares deeply about accuracy, clarity, and commercial impact. You'll own Removify's core metrics, dashboards, and reporting, creating a trusted source of truth that helps the business understand what's driving performance, where to focus, and what decisions actually matter.
 
We're a data-rich, operations-heavy business with proprietary systems, high volume, and global growth ambitions. This role isn't about producing more dashboards, it's about producing better insight, challenging assumptions, and making data genuinely useful as we scale.
 
If you enjoy translating messy, complex data into clear, actionable insight and aren't afraid to say ""that metric won't help"", this role is for you.
 
Why Removify?
Removify is a fast-growing digital reputation management company operating at scale across Australia, the US, and other global markets. We combine customer-facing products with complex internal operational systems that power how we deliver services at volume.
 
As the business has grown, so has the importance of our data. We sit on a unique mix of commercial, operational, and product data, creating real opportunities to improve performance, efficiency, and decision-making.
 
This is a chance to step into a senior, high-impact analytics role where your work directly influences how the business operates and scales.
 
What you'll be owning
You'll take full ownership of our core analytics layer, from definitions through to insight.
 
Metrics, Definitions & Source of Truth

Own and maintain the data dictionary and KPI definitions
Establish a single source of truth for business-critical metrics
Validate assumptions and ensure data accuracy and consistency
Dashboards & Reporting

Design, maintain, and rationalise dashboards across multiple BI tools
Organise reporting for clarity and usability, reducing noise, not adding to it
Ensure leaders trust the data they're using to make decisions
Insight & Analysis

Proactively analyse data to surface trends, drivers, risks, and opportunities
Translate vague or poorly formed requests into meaningful analysis
Explain why something matters, not just what happened
Commercial & Operational Understanding

Analyse revenue drivers, retention and churn, cost drivers, and operational throughput
Help the business understand efficiency, performance, and scale constraints
Partner with stakeholders to ensure insights are actionable and decision-led
Product & Customer Reporting

Work with Product and Technology teams to inform and improve customer-facing metrics and reports
Ensure external reporting is accurate, meaningful, and aligned with internal definitions
You'll work closely with the CEO and senior leaders and partner with experienced engineers who deeply understand our systems.
 
What we're looking for
You're a senior analyst who has worked in complex, commercial environments and understands the responsibility that comes with owning business-critical data. You're comfortable challenging requests, asking better questions, and prioritising insight over activity.
 
You care about correctness, context, and impact, and you want your work to actually influence decisions.
 
Must-haves

Strong SQL and data interrogation skills
Comfortable querying complex datasets and joining across multiple sources
Proven experience owning data dictionaries and metric definitions
Experience working across multiple BI or data visualisation tools, with deep expertise in at least one
Strong commercial and operational mindset (revenue, retention, costs, efficiency)
Ability to translate vague requests into clear, actionable insight
Confidence to challenge metrics and requests constructively
Focus on data accuracy, validation, and trust
Nice-to-haves

Experience in B2B, SaaS, subscription, or operations-heavy environments
Experience with services + software hybrid businesses
Familiarity with EOS scorecards or similar operating metrics
Light experience with data modelling or transformations (e.g. views, transformations)
Comfort using AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT) to accelerate analysis, validate logic, or explore insights
What this role is (and isn't)
This role is:

A senior ownership role with real influence on decision-making
A mix of analysis, insight, and stakeholder partnership
Focused on quality, clarity, and commercial impact
This role is not:

Pure data visualisation or vanity reporting
A purely academic or research-focused analytics role
A data engineering or infrastructure position
A role measured by dashboard count instead of decision impact
The perks

Salary range: $150,000 - $190,000 + super (depending on experience)
High-impact role in a fast-growing, high-volume business
Strong collaboration across Product, Tech, and Leadership
Modern office in Cremorne with great amenities (hybrid work arrangement, 1 day WFH optional for full-time)
Opportunity to shape how data is used as the business scales
Ready to make data matter?
If you're excited by the idea of owning core metrics, improving how decisions are made, and bringing clarity to a complex, high-growth environment, we'd love to hear from you.
 
Let's build the next chapter of Removify, together."
