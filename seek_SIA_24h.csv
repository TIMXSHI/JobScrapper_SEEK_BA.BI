But at a time when society is changing, we are too. We're now a nimbler business with new leadership and thinking.

For us, these are exciting times. There's a real potential for big thinkers to help us redefine what financial services could be. And turn our legacy into something even more positive and powerful for the future.

Help people create their tomorrow, while you create yours

We help people with their banking, super, retirement and finances. Through upturns, downturns, recessions, and major life transitions. Every day, we help people see and make more of their financial potential, so that they can create their tomorrow. And we've been doing it for over 170 years.

If we do our job well, we genuinely add to the prosperity of our country and its people.

How you'll make an impact

This is a key role in the 'Core team' within the AI Hub supporting the Head Of AI and other team members. As a Senior Business Analyst in the team you will lead analysis, develop insights, together with business requirements, producing materials that help deliver the agreed AI Hub Strategy, Roadmap and OKRs.

You will work closely with the business to lead and shape AI / Generative AI / Agentic AI use cases including conducting cost benefit analysis, conduct user research to define problem / opportunities, work with Product Owners to define user stories and features, support risk and other assessments applicable to AI Lifecycle, and support the development and implementation of Pilots / PoCs as applicable.

For whole-of-enterprise and / or highly novel AI systems you may also work as the Product Owner - making decisions in conjunction with stakeholders (e.g. customers) about features, functionality and other product aspects.



You'll combine deep analytical capability with a collaborative mindset to thrive in this dynamic environment. On the technical side, you bring skills in business analysis, including requirements gathering, process mapping and user story development. Familiarity with agile delivery frameworks, design thinking, and project methodologies is essential, along with a natural curiosity for emerging technologies such as Generative AI, LLMs, and agentic systems.

On the soft skills front, you're a strong communicator who can translate complex ideas into clear, actionable insights for stakeholders at all levels. You excel at building relationships, influencing decisions and navigating ambiguity with confidence. Your ability to think strategically while maintaining attention to detail sets you apart. You're a self-starter who thrives under pressure, prioritises effectively and brings a ""can-do"" attitude to every challenge. Above all, you're passionate about innovation and eager to contribute to a high-performing team that's shaping the future of AI at AMP.

You'll thrive here if…

If you can adapt from BAU to the ambiguous with ease, you'll do well here. Change is never easy, so bring your commitment, grit and growth mindset.

Because we run lean, you'll be expected to jump in and deliver across a variety of areas. Meaning, you'll be closer to the action and executive decisions that influence where we go next.

If you're someone that can hold their own, you'll find AMP quite liberating.

Why we think you'll love working at AMP

Doing what we've always done is not an option, so your clever ideas will get airtime here. You'll be encouraged to speak up and try new things. If they don't work, we move on - better for it.

We know there's no one way of doing things. So, you won't have to sacrifice who you are or how you work to fit in here. We're inclusive and flexible in many of the ways you'd expect. And in some of the ways you wouldn't. As long as your health and wellbeing come first - at home and at work.

In fact, most of what makes AMP such a welcoming, enjoyable place to work are our people. Wherever you go, you'll find moments to connect, feel valued and do meaningful work.

Whether it's through our first-class leaders who are invested in you and your success. Through year-round opportunities to volunteer, fundraise and give back to the community. Or in the everyday challenges you face as we work together to strengthen this great organisation. Challenges that will stretch you, amplify your potential and compound the impact you have.

We believe in the power of inclusion and diversity

We're dedicated to fostering inclusion, diversity, and a warm feeling of belonging at AMP. It sparks creativity, ignites innovation, and turns up the dial on the quality of our decisions and performance. This not only makes our workplace more engaged, but also leads to better connections with our customers.

We're your allies in the search for the perfect fit - when you apply, let us know how we can support you to put your best self forward during our selection process.

We're also committed to enhancing employment opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, so we enthusiastically encourage candidates from these backgrounds to apply and explore our Reconciliation Plan on our website

Ready to create your tomorrow?

If you're someone who sees opportunity where others see challenge, come and work with us in smart, progressive ways as we transform an iconic Australian brand for the future. And, through a series of career-defining moments, create your own tomorrow.

Don't procrastinate! We review applications when we get them, and if we discover the ideal candidate, we may close the role earlier than the advertised close date.

Looking forward to meeting you."

You’re a proven data leader. You’ve built teams, uplifted capability, and helped business stakeholders see the real value of data. But maybe you’re stuck somewhere overly reactive, under-resourced, or unclear on direction.

You want to lead a function with purpose. You want influence, access, and the opportunity to get it right, not just maintain what’s already there.

This is that role.

You’ll step into an organisation investing heavily in technology, modernisation, and member experience. Data is one of the core pillars of a large transformation program, and you’ll be at the centre of it, shaping the future state, guiding decision-making, and creating a proactive, insight-led data culture.

The role

Reporting to the CIO, you’ll lead a combined team of data engineers and BI specialists, approximately ten people with two direct reports. Your remit spans strategy, architecture, governance, reporting, and capability uplift.

You’ll unite two teams under one operating model, redesign the Microsoft Fabric environment, and establish the frameworks, processes, and standards that will set the company up for long-term success.

You’ll work closely with executives, program leads, and external vendors across a major two-year investment program. This is not a hands-on role, but you’ll need enough depth to guide, challenge, and protect the integrity of the data environment.

The role requires someone who listens first, communicates well, and can translate technical concepts into simple, meaningful business language. Someone who can influence at senior levels without ego. Someone who can build trust quickly.

What you’ll lead

Define the enterprise data and analytics strategy and roadmap.
Bring together data engineering and BI under one clear operating model.
Redesign and uplift the Microsoft Fabric environment.
Oversee data architecture, modelling, pipelines, and integration.
Strengthen data governance, data quality, and stewardship.
Establish an enterprise reporting framework and reduce ad hoc work.
Partner with executives and transformation leaders across all program streams.
Lift organisational data literacy and champion insight-led decision-making

What you’ll bring

Strong experience leading data, BI, or analytics teams.
Deep understanding of Microsoft Fabric, Azure, Power BI, and governance frameworks.
Ability to communicate simply with senior stakeholders.
Experience shaping data strategy and improving enterprise reporting.
Calm, composed leadership style built on listening and clarity; and
A values-aligned approach and genuine interest in building capability

Why now

You’re joining at exactly the right time: the organisation is modernising its entire digital ecosystem, and data is central to the program’s success. There’s clarity of direction, strong executive support, and significant runway to build something meaningful.

You’ll work with a CIO who values communication, leadership presence, and authenticity. You’ll have influence, visibility, and the chance to leave a lasting impact on how data is used across the organisation.

You’ll also join a values-driven, people-centred environment with flexibility, development, and a clear commitment to purpose.

Salary and benefits

$200,000 - $210,000 including superannuation.
Receive not for profit salary packaging benefits.
Hybrid model: three days WFH, two days in office.
Five weeks of paid annual leave including Christmas to New Year closure.
Birthday leave and the ability to purchase additional leave.
Strong focus on learning and professional development.
CBD offices with modern facilities.
