The Intuit Global Business Solutions Group (GBSG) is responsible for generating over half of Intuit’s global revenue.

The roll out of a more powerful, platform-backed Quickbooks across 100+ countries last November marked a pivotal milestone, and it also proved something critical: while tax codes, regulations and languages change at the border, the fundamental needs of small businesses do not. No matter the location, our customers need to get paid, manage capital, and find customers.

The International Product Organization, part of the GBSG, is seeking a dynamic product leader to translate global platform capabilities into regional market growth. Reporting to the VP of Product, International, this leader will be a critical part of the APAC Senior Leadership team, working closely with the Regional Commercial VP acting as the bridge between Intuit’s global platform and the local realities of the APAC markets.

Your mission is twofold: drive aggressive customer growth and service adoption in established markets while architecting the 'innovation engine' that streamlines the complexity of the next phase of regional expansion. You will transform fragmented market requirements into locally-relevant, integrated platform-based solutions that scale seamlessly for small and mid-market businesses across the region.

Responsibilities

APAC Product Vision & Growth Strategy: Architect and execute the end-to-end product strategy for the APAC region. You will harmonize localized customer needs with Intuit’s global platform to drive aggressive acquisition, deepen service adoption, and maximize regional P&L performance.

Strategic Market Expansion & Opportunity Mapping: Act as the lead scout for new market entry. By synthesizing macroeconomic trends, regulatory shifts, and SMB data, you will identify and prioritize the ""next horizon"" of international markets, building the 0-1 framework for successful expansion.

Localized Innovation & Roadmap Authority: Transform rigorous analysis of APAC-specific pain points—from micro-businesses to mid-market enterprises—into a high-velocity product roadmap. You ensure that regional requirements are not just ""met,"" but are leveraged as competitive advantages.

Commercial Strategy & Revenue Velocity: Partner with the APAC leadership team to define and deploy integrated GTM strategies, including localized pricing, packaging, and ecosystem hooks. You are responsible for ensuring our product value proposition resonates across diverse European and emerging markets to fuel sustainable revenue growth.

Organizational Leadership & Cultural Excellence: Build and mentor a world-class product organization that balances high-quality craft with speed. You will foster a culture of customer obsession and operational rigor, ensuring regional delivery plans align perfectly with Intuit’s overarching global mission.

Ecosystem Intelligence & Competitive Defence: Serve as the regional authority on industry trends and competitor movement. You will utilize data-driven insights to proactively pivot the roadmap, neutralizing threats and capturing first-mover advantages in the rapidly evolving fintech and AI landscape.

Qualifications

The Head of Product, APAC will bring expertise in international product, product go to market and/or corporate strategy to drive our global growth by identifying international markets to prioritize, evaluating product market fit, launching new markets, and driving.

Domain

The ideal candidate has 10-12+ years of relevant product and or product strategy experience.

Prior experience leading global/international expansion strategy, ideally with a focus on Europe.

Experience building for SMB and mid-market customers at a company with an ecosystem of products and services.

Proven experience in harmonizing product strategies across diverse offerings (e.g., finance, marketing, payments) to build a unified customer ecosystem.

Demonstrated success leveraging advanced technologies (AI/ML) to solve complex customer problems, especially in areas like localization, compliance, or predictive insights.

Proven track record of successfully championing trajectory-changing business shifts for organizations, including commercial and product innovation that translates to revenue and customer growth.

Exceptional at prioritization and decision-making -- narrowing to the critical few.

Effective at working cross-functionally in a large matrix-style organization to ensure teams can move with speed and maximum impact.

Exceptional problem-solving skills and ability to translate complex data into actionable insights.

Expertise in translating complex regional regulatory and compliance requirements (e.g., VAT, payroll, GDPR) into non-negotiable, locally relevant product roadmaps.

Leadership And Managerial

Exceptional ability to influence beyond their direct team to the portfolio level, company, and executive leadership level, including cross-functional partners and potential stakeholders.

Experience managing teams that cover more than one primary offering.

Identify gaps in the dataset and feed high quality requirements through to data engineering. Triage all business requests as the first port of call. 

Build and manage a team of analysts, mentor and work closely with the team to remove data-related and technical roadblocks. 

Manage analysis work pipeline and prioritisation through collaboration with data scientists, engineers, and cross functional teams. 

Work with Commercial leadership in building quarterly and yearly analytics roadmap.

Hybrid | 3 days p/w on site | Melbourne | Day rate | Parking nearby

This is not a purely strategic or advisory governance role. It’s a hands-on position for someone who enjoys getting into messy data, asking the hard questions, and working closely with the business to fix real problems.
If you’re the kind of person who likes understanding why data is broken, explaining it clearly to non-technical teams, and then helping put the fix in place — this role will suit you.

What you’ll be doing
This role is approximately 50/50 hands-on delivery and stakeholder engagement.

You will:

Monitor, track and report on data quality metrics and issues
Conduct root cause analysis on data issues and recommend practical remediation actions
Work with business teams to clean up data and prevent repeat issues
Define, document and maintain data definitions, metadata and business glossaries
Build and maintain Power BI dashboards and regular operational reporting
Use advanced Excel and SQL daily (some scripting/coding experience is highly desirable)
Support the development of data standards, governance processes and roadmaps
Work closely with delivery teams on a high-profile billing program
What the hiring team is really looking for
They are prioritising communication and mindset just as much as technical capability.

You’ll be successful if you:

Can confidently explain Data Governance to people who don’t work in data
Can explain metadata and data quality issues in plain English
Are comfortable having frequent conversations across the business 
Are inquisitive, ask “why”, and dig deeper into issues
Can work independently once given direction (no hand-holding)
Stay positive and solutions-focused in complex, high-pressure environments
Essential experience
Hands-on experience implementing or operating data governance practices
Strong experience with data quality monitoring, reporting and issue management
Proven root cause analysis experience on data issues
Metadata management, data definitions, business glossaries and documentation
Advanced Excel, strong SQL, and Power BI dashboarding
Experience working with billing, customer, financial or transactional data
Strong stakeholder engagement and communication skills
Experience working in utilities, financial services, government or large enterprise environments
Highly regarded
Certification in Data Governance or Data Management (e.g. CDMP, CDPSE, DCAM)
Experience stepping into “fix it” roles where things are already live and imperfect
Why this role?
You’ll have real ownership and impact
You’ll work with a passionate, collaborative data leader who values open communication
You’ll help stabilise and improve a critical billing and customer data environment
This is a role for someone who wants to add value quickly, not sit on the sidelines
If this sounds like you, apply now or reach out to me at Lfrank@launchrecruitment.com.au for a confidential conversation.

If you’re more strategy-focused or prefer minimal stakeholder interaction, this role is unlikely to be the right fit — and that’s completely okay."
