Integrate automation and AI into finance workflows (forecasting, reconciliations, reporting, scenario planning).
Improve operational efficiency by reducing manual processes and increasing system integration.
Partner with Engineering and Data teams to ensure financial systems integrate seamlessly into the broader tech stack.
 

5. Data, Analytics & AI Enablement

Build and oversee a modern financial data architecture with a single source of truth.
Leverage advanced analytics and AI to enhance forecasting accuracy and predictive modeling.
Embed AI into workflow decision-making (e.g., automated variance explanations, anomaly detection, cash flow prediction).
Promote data governance, reporting accuracy, and analytical rigor across the organization.
 

6. Stakeholder Management

Serve as a trusted advisor to the CFO and executive leadership team.
Partner closely with Revenue, Product, Operations, and Engineering leaders.
Present financial insights in a clear, strategic, and decision-oriented manner.
Support external stakeholder interactions including Board and investors where applicable.
