Your New Role

You’ll leverage your broad understanding of technology solutions and architectures in Investments, with deep familiarity of the underlying architecture of platforms such as LUSID, Aladdin, Calypso, Bloomberg, iLevel or similar, together with strong understanding of Investment data flows, the different requirements of IBOR vs ABOR and both listed and unlisted assets. You’ll know how aggregated investment data views are built and set up robust, scalable operating models that support our strategic goals.

A researcher at heart, you’ll stay ahead of technology best practice by building strong relationships with vendors, competitors, and internal stakeholders. You’ll wear a project management hat to implement changes, drive continuous improvement, and ensure our operating model is agile, compliant, and ready for the future.
