About the role:

The Senior Director of Finance & Strategy is a senior finance leader responsible for enterprise financial planning, performance management, and strategic execution.

This position will drive financial discipline while building scalable systems and intelligent workflows that enable data-driven decision-making across the organization.

What your day to day will look like:

1. Enterprise Planning & FP&A Leadership

Own the annual operating plan (AOP), long-range planning (LRP), and rolling forecast processes.
Lead company-wide budgeting, re-forecasting, and scenario modelling.
Develop driver-based financial models aligned to SaaS metrics (ARR, NRR, CAC, LTV, gross margin, churn).
Deliver executive-ready reporting for CFO, CEO, and Board.
Ensure forecast accuracy, strong variance analysis, and forward-looking risk assessment.

2. Reporting, Metrics & KPI Governance

Establish and govern enterprise KPI frameworks aligned to company strategy.
Ensure consistency in definitions and integrity across financial and operational metrics.
Collaborate with RevOps on monthly and quarterly business reviews with clear performance narratives.

3. Strategic Finance & Corporate Strategy

Partner with the CFO to translate strategy into measurable financial outcomes.
Steward capital allocation analysis, pricing strategy, unit economics optimization, and investment prioritization.
Build business cases for product launches, market expansion, and strategic initiatives.
Support potential M&A evaluation and integration planning as needed.

4. Systems Building & Workflow Optimization

Design and implement scalable finance systems and processes.
Oversee ERP, planning systems, and reporting tools optimization.
Integrate automation and AI into finance workflows (forecasting, reconciliations, reporting, scenario planning).
Improve operational efficiency by reducing manual processes and increasing system integration.
Partner with Engineering and Data teams to ensure financial systems integrate seamlessly into the broader tech stack.
 

5. Data, Analytics & AI Enablement

Build and oversee a modern financial data architecture with a single source of truth.
Leverage advanced analytics and AI to enhance forecasting accuracy and predictive modeling.
Embed AI into workflow decision-making (e.g., automated variance explanations, anomaly detection, cash flow prediction).
Promote data governance, reporting accuracy, and analytical rigor across the organization.
 

6. Stakeholder Management

Serve as a trusted advisor to the CFO and executive leadership team.
Partner closely with Revenue, Product, Operations, and Engineering leaders.
Present financial insights in a clear, strategic, and decision-oriented manner.
Support external stakeholder interactions including Board and investors where applicable.

7. Team Leadership

Lead and develop the FP&A and strategic finance teams.
Strengthen financial acumen across the organization.
Build scalable processes and team structures to support growth.

Qualifications


 What you need to succeed:

10+ years of progressive finance experience, including senior FP&A or strategic finance leadership.
Strong experience in SaaS environments, with a solid understanding of recurring revenue models, subscription metrics and unit economics is required.
Experience with embedded fintech models (e.g., payments, capital, billing infrastructure) is considered an advantage.

Experience embedding AI and automation into finance workflows.
Advanced financial modeling and analytical skills.
