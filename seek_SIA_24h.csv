Carinity believe that true care begins with seeing the person - not just their needs, but their story, strengths, and their hopes. Whether it's providing aged care, walking alongside young people, supporting families, or offering spiritual comfort, the care provided by Carinity is deeply personal. Understanding is the foundation of everything they do - because meaningful care requires a genuine connection.

Their care has a lasting impact. It’s felt in the confidence of a student finding their path, the peace of an older person feeling safe and valued, and the strength of a family supported through life’s challenges. Founded in faith 75 years ago, and driven by purpose, Carinity exists to make a difference – one person, one moment, one lasting impact at a time.

About the Position

This is an exciting opportunity to join Carinity in a newly created leadership role within Carinity’s Aged Care division.

You will collaborate closely with teams across Finance, Operations, ICT, and HR to influence decisions at the highest levels and ensure the business remains agile in a changing aged care landscape. This role is not to be mistaken for a traditional reporting role. It is to uncover meaningful insights from the data and guide the business in turning those insights into practical, measurable actions. By leading cross-functional initiatives and embedding a culture of data-informed decision-making, your influence will extend across the Aged Care division.

Based at Carinity’s Gaythorne corporate office, with occasional travel throughout Queensland, this position offers a unique opportunity to combine strategic leadership with purpose-driven impact.

You will bring tertiary qualifications in Business, Analytics, Health Services, or a related discipline, along with significant experience in analytics, business performance, or financial modelling, ideally from complex, regulated, and customer centric environments. You will be highly proficient in tools such as Power BI and Excel and experienced in working with HRIS and workforce data.

As a natural collaborator, you will thrive on building relationships across teams, simplifying complex information into actionable insights, and influencing decision-making at senior levels.
