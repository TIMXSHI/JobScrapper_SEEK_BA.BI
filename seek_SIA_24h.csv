Stakeholder Management: Exceptional communication skills with a proven ability to engage, influence, and manage complex stakeholder groups across multiple departments.

Analytical Rigour: Strong skills in process mapping, data analysis, testing (UAT), and producing high-quality documentation.

Leadership Competencies: Demonstrable evidence against the 'Individual Contributor' competencies of Vision (Leading Change, Making Insightful Decisions), Results (Building Enduring Relationships, Driving Accountability), and Accountability (Pursuing Continuous Growth, Sound Governance).
