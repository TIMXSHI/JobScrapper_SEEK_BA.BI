You will be responsible for end-to-end process design and re-engineering, driving measurable gains in efficiency, cost reduction, customer experience enhancement, and risk mitigation. This includes championing a culture of continuous improvement and leveraging advanced analytics and AI solutions to optimise processes.

You will work closely with senior leaders and executives, influencing strategy and reporting on progress. Success in this role requires experience leading complex, cross-functional projects, ideally within the financial services industry.

Expertise in leveraging AI solutions for process design and improvement is highly regarded. This is a high-impact role for a strategic process improvement specialist who thrives in a challenging, fast-paced environment.

 

Key responsibilities:

Lead end-to-end process design and re-engineering projects utilising your Lean Six Sigma Black Belt expertise.
Mentor and coach process improvement specialists and business SMEs in Lean Six Sigma practices.
Champion a culture of continuous improvement and data-driven decision-making.

Exceptional Leadership and Communication: Articulate your abilities to effectively communicate complex information to diverse audiences, influence stakeholders at all levels, and build consensus around process improvement initiatives.

Advanced Analytics & AI Expertise: Highlight any experience you have leveraging AI solutions to enhance process optimisation and decision-making. This is highly regarded.
Human-Centred Design: If you possess Human-Centred Design certification, highlight your understanding and experience with this approach to process improvement. This is also highly regarded.

 

We offer flexible work options that put our people first, working in a hybrid model with a minimum local Head Office attendance requirement determined by your Leader, to find a rhythm that works best for you and your team.
