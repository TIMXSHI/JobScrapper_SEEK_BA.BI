This team will develop products using Lean Startup principles and Agile methodologies to ensure rapid iteration and responsiveness to customer needs.

ABOUT THE ROLE

We need a business analyst who can transform product vision into requirements so clear that delivery teams can build without hesitation. You'll be the critical link that determines whether our teams work efficiently and whether what we ship actually solves client problems.

The impact you'll make: Your specifications will determine whether six-figure projects succeed or fail. Poor requirements cost us client relationships and team velocity. By navigating ambiguous client needs and creating crystal-clear requirements, you'll be accountable for ensuring every sprint delivers real value. When you get it right, you multiply the effectiveness of 20+ people across delivery teams.

The reality: You'll be the main point of contact on one of our largest projects, working in a team with multiple stakeholders who have competing priorities across different technical teams. Sprint cycles are 2 weeks. You'll need to be brilliant at context-switching and maintaining quality under pressure.

WHAT YOU WILL OWN

Requirements & Delivery (70% of your time)

Write product and user requirements documents that engineers can implement with minimal clarification questions

Define and validate solutions through user testing and prototypes

Help create wireframes, flows, and specifications that eliminate ambiguity

Orchestrate alignment between client stakeholders, designers, architects, engineering and quality assurance teams

Review architecture designs and provide product perspective

Run continuous user validation throughout development cycles

Document business rules and data models that become the single source of truth

Use AI tools strategically to improve requirements quality and catch gaps

Cross-Team Collaboration & Client Partnership (20% of your time)

Navigate ambiguous client requests and extract clear, actionable requirements

Build trusted relationships with client stakeholders and internal teams

Translate between business language, design thinking, and technical constraints

Facilitate workshops and discussions that bring clarity to complex problems

Surface misalignments early and drive teams towards shared understanding

Planning & Performance (10% of your time)

Refine backlog and make defensible prioritization decisions

Apply AI tools to synthesize feedback and spot opportunities

ABOUT YOU

What Success Will Look Like

In your first few months, you'll be making an impact when you:

Help most sprints complete smoothly with minimal rework—we track this and typically see 80%+ success rates

Work through ambiguous client requests and turn them into validated solutions

Develop strong working relationships with key client and internal stakeholders

Create documentation that becomes a go-to reference for the team

People who thrive here:

Work effectively with autonomy, they identify what needs doing and do it

Welcome feedback and review as opportunities to strengthen their work

Enjoy the energy of coordinating across teams to achieve shared outcomes

Make clear decisions when needed, even when opinions differ

Have experience where their analysis directly impacted significant business outcomes

We move fast, give direct feedback, and encourage you to push back when something doesn't make sense. If that environment appeals to you, keep reading.

WHAT YOU BRING

Must-haves:

Senior collaboration capability: You thrive working across client teams, design, architecture, and engineering. You're the person everyone wants on complex projects because you bring clarity and alignment.

Clarity from chaos: You navigate ambiguous situations with confidence, asking the right questions to uncover what's really needed. You've done this many times before.

Writing excellence: You write requirements that rarely need clarification. Your documentation is famous for its clarity and becomes the reference point for entire projects.

User validation obsession: You reflexively test assumptions with users before building. You know how to run effective validation sessions.

Able to build technical fluency: You are able to understand architectural constraints and speak confidently with engineers. You can challenge technical decisions when they don't serve business outcomes.

Required Experience

4-6 years in business analysis, product analysis, or product management roles

Proven track record working with external clients and managing their expectations

Experience leading analysis on complex, multi-team initiatives

Strong experience collaborating with cross-functional delivery teams (design, engineering, architecture)
