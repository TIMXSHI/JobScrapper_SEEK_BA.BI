Forget what you know about typical analyst roles. This isn't about building decks that disappear into committees or running models that never see daylight. This is about sitting at the table where decisions get made, capital gets deployed, and businesses get built.

The Castle Steering Group is the agile innovation engine behind a dynamic multi-entity portfolio spanning hospitality, property, technology, and energy. Its the team that identifies what's next, pressure-tests what matters, and drives momentum across existing businesses while hunting for the opportunities that will define our future.

We're looking for an exceptional Research Analyst—a high-achiever with 5-7 years of battle-tested experience who's ready to move from advising on deals to being inside them. If you've been waiting for a role where your analysis directly influences investment decisions and your recommendations shape strategy, this is it.

What You'll Actually Do

Investment Research & Deal Flow - You'll actively research and evaluate new investment opportunities across sectors, conducting rigorous market analysis, competitive positioning, and commercial due diligence. You'll build the business cases that inform go/no-go decisions on new ventures and acquisitions

Strategic Due Diligence - Execute detailed investigations into potential investments—financial modeling, cross-comparisons against market leaders, risk assessment, and operational feasibility. Your work will directly inform capital allocation decisions, not sit in a filing cabinet.

Portfolio Momentum Management - Keep existing businesses focused and moving forward. You'll identify operational bottlenecks, research efficiency improvements, analyze performance metrics, and recommend actions that unlock growth across the portfolio.

Board-Ready Analysis - Prepare investment memoranda, business cases, and strategic briefing materials for the Group CEO and Castle Steering Group. Your analysis needs to be sharp, defensible, and decision-ready—no fluff, just insight.

Cross-Functional Intelligence - Work alongside the Strategic Advisor on high-level strategy, collaborate with the Investment Manager on deal structuring, and coordinate with the CEO's EA to ensure seamless execution of research deliverables and presentations.

Market Intelligence & Trends - Maintain ongoing sector surveillance across hospitality, property, technology, and energy. Identify emerging opportunities, competitive threats, and market shifts before they become obvious. Be the person who sees what's coming.

Who We're Looking For

5-7 years in investment banking, management consulting, or corporate strategy
Direct experience in deal analysis, due diligence, or investment evaluation
Demonstrated ability to build robust financial models and business cases
Track record of influencing senior stakeholders with analytical insights
Excellent written and verbal communication—you can distill complexity into clarity

The Differentiators

High-Achiever Mentality

You're the person who consistently exceeds expectations and raises the bar
Track record of being the ""go-to"" analyst on your team
Intellectually curious—you dig deeper than required because you genuinely want to understand
Comfortable with ambiguity and able to structure unstructured problems

Agile Operator

You thrive in fast-moving environments where priorities shift and speed matters
Comfortable working across multiple projects simultaneously without losing quality
Don't need hand-holding—you identify what needs to be done and do it
Resilient under pressure and energized by intensity rather than overwhelmed by it

Commercial Instinct

You understand that analysis exists to drive decisions, not to be academically interesting
Can balance thoroughness with pragmatism—knowing when 80% certainty is enough to move
Sharp commercial awareness across multiple sectors
Think like an investor, not just an analyst

Team Player with Presence

Confident presenting to and engaging with the Group CEO and senior leadership
Collaborative approach when working with Strategic Advisor, Investment Manager, and EA
Professional demeanor with discretion around sensitive commercial information
Humble enough to learn, confident enough to challenge assumptions constructively

What Success Looks Like

You'll know you're succeeding when:

Your investment recommendations are consistently adopted and inform capital decisions
The CEO relies on your analysis to pressure-test opportunities and strategies
Existing businesses accelerate because you've identified the bottlenecks and solutions
The Steering Group views you as a trusted member of the inner circle, not just support staff
You've built a reputation for delivering sharp, actionable insights under tight timelines
You're involved in conversations about strategy, not just asked to run the numbers

How to Apply

If you're a high-achieving analyst who's ready to step from the sidelines into the arena, we want to hear from you. Please submit your CV along with a brief cover letter"
