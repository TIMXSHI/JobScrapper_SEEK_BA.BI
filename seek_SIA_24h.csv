Founders Edge partners with established SME business owners (typically $1M–$10M+ in annual revenue) to help them scale with strategic precision and confidence. Our programs blend board-level strategy, financial modelling, and growth mentorship to help founders achieve extraordinary results — both in business and life.

The Role

We’re looking for a commercially savvy Business Analyst who can turn strategy into numbers — someone who thrives on mapping out how a business can grow over a 10-year horizon using leverage points such as pricing, lead generation, conversion rates, margins, capacity, and team structure.

You’ll work closely with our founder Ryll Burgin-Doyle and our coaching team to create and refine Revenue Resource Maps — dynamic spreadsheets that show business owners exactly how strategic tweaks compound into millions in additional profit and long-term value.

This role requires not just financial skill, but rapport, insight, and curiosity — the ability to engage with SME owners, understand their business model, and translate conversations into clear financial scenarios.

Key Responsibilities

Build and refine 10-year financial growth models (“Revenue Resource Maps”) tailored to each client’s business.



Work with coaches and clients to identify key leverage points for growth (pricing, margins, team utilisation, lead generation, etc.).



Translate qualitative strategy into quantitative outcomes (e.g., revenue targets, profit trajectories, team structure impacts).



Present findings in an engaging, plain-English way — bridging the gap between data and decision-making.



Ensure accuracy, clarity, and alignment with Founders Edge frameworks.



Contribute to ongoing refinement of the Revenue Resource Map templates and systems.



About You

Strong background in financial analysis, business modelling, or commercial advisory — ideally with SME experience (not just corporate).



Comfortable working directly with business owners and senior leaders.



Excellent communication and interpersonal skills — you can make numbers engaging and relevant.



You are excellent at working with Excel/Google Sheets skills; bonus if you can build or improve dynamic models.



Commercial understanding of growth drivers in service-based businesses (particularly building/construction, trade services, or professional services).



Highly organised, detail-oriented, and deadline-driven.



Strategic thinker who understands how to connect operational levers to long-term value creation.



Preferred Background

Experience in SME consulting, business coaching, or fractional CFO/Financial Controller roles.



Prior work in the building, construction, or trade services sector highly regarded.



Exposure to business strategy frameworks and business-growth models a plus.



What You’ll Get

Work directly with a world-class business strategist and her team.



Meaningful, high-impact work helping entrepreneurs grow and thrive.



Flexibility to work remotely, part-time, or full-time (depending on experience).



Competitive compensation with opportunity for ongoing engagement.




You’ll be part of a fast moving, fast growing company that is all about changing lives, transforming businesses and making a difference. We care for our clients deeply and each other. 




Payment:  Generous Hourly Contract Rate Based on Experience.
