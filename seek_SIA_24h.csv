What you’ll be doing
Analyse trends and key drivers to clearly explain performance variances vs budget
Lead forecasting and reforecasting cycles with a forward-looking lens
Consolidate inputs from multiple commercial finance teams and identify performance gaps — then help shape how to close them
Deliver ad hoc analysis (e.g. digital vs traditional revenue streams) to support strategic decisions
Act as the SME between systems/data teams and finance — translating data into commercial insight
Build clear, executive-ready decks and presentation packs for senior stakeholders
What we’re looking for
4+ years’ experience in a commercial Finance Business Partnering role
Strong variance analysis and forecasting capability
Comfortable consolidating and challenging numbers across business units
Confident communicator who can present to senior stakeholders
Strong PowerPoint skills, you know how to tell a story, not just build slides
High calibre profile, second movers from Big 4/Mid-tier with proven commercial BP exposure are encouraged
This is not a back-office reporting role. It’s for someone who enjoys digging into performance drivers, asking “why?”, and influencing outcomes.
If you want exposure to a large, complex environment where digital transformation and commercial performance genuinely matter — this is worth a conversation."

Alinta Energy is one of Australia’s biggest energy retailers, generators and developers with over 1.1 million customers. Australia’s energy system is undergoing the biggest transformation in its history and we’re right there with it. We’re investing in and developing large-scale renewables and storage projects as part of our ongoing effort to provide our customers with reliable, affordable and sustainable energy.

We understand that flexibility matters when considering your next role. Let us know your requirements, and we’ll carefully consider how we might accommodate them.

Ready to make a real impact?

This role sits at the centre of Alinta Energy’s strategic decision‑making, supporting the Corporate Strategy team during a period of growth, integration and transformation. It is not a traditional accounting or reporting role - instead, it’s designed for someone with 3-5+ years’ experience who enjoys strategic analysis, commercial thinking and contributing to enterprise‑wide decisions.

You’ll work across a broad and changing set of priorities, including assessing investment opportunities, supporting capital allocation decisions and contributing to long‑term planning. A key part of the role involves using and maintaining the corporate model and five‑year business plan to test scenarios, evaluate options and support executive decision‑making, while coordinating inputs from stakeholders across the business.

With regular exposure to senior leaders and visibility across Retail, Merchant Energy, Power Generation and Finance, this role is ideal for someone early‑to‑mid career from a corporate strategy, consulting or commercial analysis background. It offers the opportunity to build a strong enterprise‑wide understanding of the business and develop skills that open pathways into other strategic roles over time.

At Alinta Energy, we’re taking real action to deliver reliable and sustainable energy for Australia - and that practical approach runs through everything we do. You’ll get clear direction, genuine flexibility, and the support you need to grow, all while working on projects that make a lasting difference. We’re big enough to create impact, but small enough that your ideas and effort will always be seen.

There are plenty of other great benefits of working for Alinta Energy, including flexible working, energy discounts, an Employee Assistance Program (EAP), a paid volunteer day each year, fully stocked kitchens, and lots more.

What you’ll do

Assess investment opportunities and capital allocation options aligned to business strategy
Maintain and use the corporate model and five‑year business plan to test strategic scenarios
Undertake scenario, portfolio and competitor analysis to inform executive decision‑making
Support enterprise‑wide strategic initiatives through commercial analysis and stakeholder coordination
Prepare strategy, investment and executive presentations for the CFO and senior leadership team

Your experience

3-5+ years’ experience in corporate strategy, consulting, transaction advisory or commercial analysis
Tertiary qualification in a relevant discipline such as finance, economics, commerce or strategy
Strong understanding of corporate finance and financial evaluation, rather than statutory reporting
Advanced Excel and PowerPoint skills, with the ability to synthesise analysis into executive‑level insights
Proven experience coordinating complex, cross‑functional work and engaging confidently with senior stakeholders

Please note this role requires full working rights within Australia.

This role is best suited to a commercially minded individual who thrives in a fast‑moving, complex environment and enjoys applying analysis to strategic decision‑making.
