Yeah… this isn't one of those roles.

This is a chance to actually use data to make a difference - protecting customers, improving digital journeys, and shaping how millions of Aussies experience one of the country's biggest brands.

This household brand name are investing heavily in their Customer First program, and you'll be the digital analytics expert making sure every click, tap, and touchpoint tells a story - a story that leads to better decisions, not just prettier charts.

You'll sit in the Digital Analytics team, partnering with UX, Product, and Tech to deliver end-to-end digital analytics solutions.

From tagging and tracking through to insight generation - you own it all.

You'll:

Turn business objectives into measurable outcomes - defining KPIs, OKRs, and the data behind them

Write and validate tracking specs that actually work (because you know the pain when they don't)

Build dashboards that people actually use in Tableau, Power BI, GA4, Looker, and FullStory

Dive into SQL/BigQuery to test, validate, and uncover what the dashboards don't show

Tell stories with data - the kind that influence strategy, not just tick boxes

What You Bring

3+ years in digital analytics, ideally within a large, data-heavy environment (telco, finance, or consulting would be perfect)

You know your way around GA4 (Google Analytics), Looker Studio, and digital tracking implementations

You speak fluent SQL, and you're comfortable in BigQuery or similar

You've built dashboards in Tableau or Power BI that didn't just look good - they changed behaviour

You're proactive, collaborative, and not afraid to challenge the brief

Why You'll Love It

You won't just analyse data - you'll influence what happens next.

You'll work with a team that values curiosity over compliance, collaboration over control, and insights over outputs.

It's a role with meaning - using analytics to protect customers, improve experiences, and make data genuinely matter.
