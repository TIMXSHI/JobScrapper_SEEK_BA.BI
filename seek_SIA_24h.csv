About the Role

We’re looking for an experienced Lead Data Engineer to join the team in a key Leadership role, as part of our Analytics team. This role will be responsible for architecting, building and evolving our world class data platform that services the entire organisation. 

As a hands-on technical leader, you will lead a high performing team of Engineers in solving business problems backed by a reliable and modern data platform. A core part of the role will be to drive the development of data models and pipelines, implement MLOps best practices and ensure data governance across analytics and AI initiatives. 

You’ll blend strategic thinking and vision for Data with a hands-on, detail-oriented approach, requiring deep expertise in modern data engineering, cloud infrastructure, and emerging technologies such as Generative AI.

What you’ll do:

• Lead the design, development, and maintenance of scalable data pipelines using Apache Airflow, dbt, and Azure Data Factory.

• Architect and optimise our Snowflake data warehouse, including schema design, performance tuning, and cost management.

• Implement and enforce data governance policies, including data masking, role-based access control, and compliance with regulatory standards.

• Drive MLOps initiatives: model deployment, monitoring, retraining pipelines, and integration with CI/CD workflows.

• Collaborate with cross-functional teams to operationalise ML models, including Generative AI solutions, into production systems.

• Partner with the Platforms team to oversee infrastructure-as-code deployments using Pulumi, Docker, Kubernetes and cloud-native services (Azure, AWS).

• Lead, coach  and guide a team of engineers, fostering a culture of best practices in coding, testing, and documentation alongside a culture of continuous learning and psychological safety.

• Partner with stakeholders across the business such as Operations to translate business requirements into technical solutions.

What you’ll bring

• 7+ years experience in data engineering, with at least 2 years experience leading a team, ideally in a fast paced, high growth environment. 

• Strong proficiency in Apache Airflow, dbt, and Azure Data Factory.

• Expertise in Snowflake, including advanced SQL, performance optimisation, and security features.

• Experience with real-time data processing (Apache Flink, Kafka).

• Proven experience with MLOps tools and frameworks (MLflow, Kubeflow, or similar).

• Hands-on experience deploying and integrating Generative AI models (OpenAI, Hugging Face, or similar).

• Solid understanding of data governance frameworks and compliance requirements (GDPR, CCPA).

• Proficiency in Python and SQL; familiarity with PySpark or other distributed processing frameworks is a plus.

• Experience with cloud platforms (Azure, AWS) and infrastructure-as-code tools (Pulumi, Terraform).

• Strong CI/CD skills with Azure Pipelines or equivalent.

• Excellent communication skills, with the ability to interact effectively with technical and non-technical stakeholders

• Strong problem solving skills, with a continuous learning mindset. 

Preferred Qualifications:

• Familiarity with analytics tools and BI platforms.
