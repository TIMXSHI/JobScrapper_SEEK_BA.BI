As a Business Process Analyst in our Digital Transformation Office, you’ll play a critical role in making life easier for our front line leaders.  You will partner closely with our Child, Youth & Family (CYF) and Disability & Mental Health (DMH) practice teams to deeply understand how frontline work really happens — the pressures, the complexity, the workarounds, and the moments that matter to carers and clients. Your purpose will be to simplify and streamline core practice processes so our carers and front line leaders and employees can spend more time in meaningful connection with the people we support, and less time wrestling with paperwork, duplication, and inefficient workflows.

This is a full‑time maximum‑term contract through to June 2027 that can be located anywhere in Australia, where you have full flexibility to work from home or one of our offices with some travel required for in person collaboration.

Translate current states into clear, visual, standardised workflows.
Identify opportunities for simplification, standardisation, and waste reduction.
Highlight and articulate the “points of transformation” — the exact moments where the process becomes easier, faster, or safer.
Redesign future‑state workflows using Lean, continuous improvement and human‑centred design approaches.
Ensure processes are practical, compliant, and reflect the lived reality of CYF and DMH practice.
Identify and define measurable benefits across efficiency, quality, client experience and workforce experience.
Support benefits tracking, benefits realisation, and clear linkage between improvements and frontline outcomes.
Communicate process concepts in simple, accessible language.
Provide inputs for training, change narratives, operating models and system requirements.
Facilitate cross‑functional alignment across business, ICT and governance groups.

Skills & Experience

Demonstrated experience in process analysis, optimisation or business improvement in complex, highly regulated environments.
Proven capability mapping and redesigning Level 2 and Level 3 processes using Lean Six Sigma or similar frameworks.
Ability to identify inefficiencies, risks, and real‑world pain points — even when they’re not explicitly stated.
Strong facilitation skills, with experience engaging frontline practitioners, leaders and technical teams (most of which will be online).
Excellent communication skills, able to translate complex process logic into clear, plain‑English insights for various stakeholders.
Strong analytical skills with experience quantifying benefits and demonstrating real, measurable improvements.
High‑quality documentation skills using tools such as Visio, Miro or Lucidchart.
Experience working collaboratively with ICT, Business Analysts, designers or architects to translate process changes into system or implementation impacts.

Successful candidates will be required to clear probity checks including National Criminal History Record Check.

Benefits

Join a team that encourages innovative thinking
Challenging position working in a modern, best practice ICT environment
Excellent tax benefits & monthly rostered days off

You’ll work at the intersection of property, finance and procurement, helping the business understand where money is going, why it’s moving, and what actions make sense.

· Translate complex information into practical insights for senior stakeholders

About you

· Strong problem-solver from a commercial property environment

· Comfortable working with large, imperfect datasets and ambiguity

· Experience using analytics and reporting tools to enable decisions, not just produce reports

· Confident communicator who can explain the why, not just the numbers

Experience & qualifications

· Typically 6–10+ years in a commercial, portfolio or property analyst role

· Degree in Finance, Accounting, Business, Property, or similar (or equivalent experience)

ROLLER isn’t your average SaaS company. We operate globally across 30+ countries, powering millions of real-world experiences in the leisure and attractions industry. What we build doesn’t just live on a screen. It shows up in busy venues, peak weekends, and unforgettable moments for guests.

Our mission is simple but ambitious: help operators run better businesses while creating great guest experiences. That means solving complex, real-world problems across ticketing, point of sale, self-service, memberships, kiosks, and digital waivers, all at meaningful scale.

Just as importantly, it’s the people. We’re a team of 300+ smart, grounded, and genuinely passionate humans working across the globe. We care about quality, ownership, and doing work we’re proud of, without taking ourselves too seriously.

We’re growing fast, aiming high, and building something that matters. If you want to work on real problems, with real customers, alongside people who care deeply about their craft and impact, ROLLER is a great place to do it.




About the Role

We’re looking for a curious, commercially minded Data Analyst to join our Venue Operations Tribe. This role partners closely with Product Managers and tribe leadership to help us understand how venues use ROLLER day-to-day, which features create real value for different venue “archetypes”, and how we can drive smarter product and adoption decisions with evidence and not guesswork.

You’ll work across product usage, feature availability/adoption, and venue performance insights, connecting patterns in the data to decisions that improve outcomes for customers and the business.

This role is based in Melbourne with a hybrid working model from our South Melbourne office.




Why You'll Enjoy This Role

🚀 Real Scale, Real Momentum - If you want your judgment to matter, this is the place. ROLLER is a global, rapidly scaling SaaS business backed by Insight Partners. In 2025, we powered 90 million guest experiences across those 35 countries and we’re growing fast towards 1 billion experiences a year.

📈 Your Work Will Change Real Decisions - Your analysis will directly influence roadmap bets, feature investments, and adoption strategy. This isn’t reporting for reporting’s sake - your work will shape what we build and why.

🤝 Work Side-by-Side With Product Leaders - You’ll partner closely with PMs and tribe leadership - helping frame sharper questions, challenge assumptions, and turn data into direction. You won’t be operating at arm’s length.

🔎 Solve Real Product Analytics Problems - From event streams and audit logs to feature journeys and venue archetypes, you’ll dig into behavioural data to understand how customers actually use ROLLER - not just whether a KPI moved.




Why You Want To Work With Us!

❤️ Loved by Customers - ROLLER is consistently highly rated on Capterra and G2, and trusted by leading operators worldwide. That doesn’t happen by accident. Customer obsession isn’t a value on a wall here, it’s embedded in how we prioritise, build, and measure success.

🏆 A Great Place People Choose to Stay - We’ve been Great Place to Work certified across multiple regions for several years running. That reflects a culture that values trust, autonomy, and growth, and an environment where high standards and psychological safety coexist.

💸 Competitive Package & Real Career Growth - We offer competitive compensation and benefits aligned to the level of ownership we expect. As ROLLER scales, so do the opportunities. People grow here by taking on bigger problems, broader scope, and greater responsibility. Progression is driven by impact and capability, not tenure, and strong performance is recognised and rewarded.




What You'll Do

Drive product and adoption insights: Analyse feature availability, activation and usage to understand what’s working, for who, and why.

Build venue archetypes & playbooks: Identify venue “shapes” (segments/archetypes) that get value from different features and help build data-backed playbooks to nudge the right venues to the right capabilities.

Deep-dive event, audit and activity logs: Go beyond simple “feature on/off” signals, use event streams and audit logs to understand behaviours, journeys, and usage patterns.

Support performance-oriented analysis: Help uncover what “great” looks like, identifying high-performing venues and the behaviours that correlate with exceptional operational outcomes, then surface insights we can share broadly.

Create dashboards & reporting in our BI environment: Build clear, trusted reporting and dashboards (primarily in Looker) that help PMs move quickly and confidently.

Turn analysis into decisions: Provide recommendations to influence product decisions, balancing speed vs accuracy based on the decision context and clearly communicating assumptions/limitations.

Partner cross-functionally: Collaborate with PMs, tribe leadership, and occasionally data/engineering counterparts to improve data quality, expand what’s available in Looker, and define better questions upstream.




About You

Experience using at least one modern BI tool (Looker, Tableau, or Power BI) and can ramp into a new tool quickly.

Strong analytical skills and the ability to work with imperfect/real-world data, knowing when something is “good enough” vs when accuracy is critical.

Product analytics experience (feature adoption, funnels/journeys, engagement/retention patterns).

Confidence querying and wrangling data (e.g. from transactional databases or event datasets), not just working with perfectly-modelled BI layers.

A track record of influencing decisions (ideally in product or SaaS environments), you’ve helped teams change direction, validate bets, or stop a bad idea based on evidence.

Curiosity and product-thinking - you don’t just answer what’s asked, you explore what else the data is saying and proactively surface it.

Strong communication skills with the ability to translate messy analysis into clear insights for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.




Perks!

You get to work on a category-leading product that customers love in a fun, high-growth industry - check our Capterra and G2 reviews.

4 ROLLER Recharge days per year (that is 4 additional days of leave that we all take off together as a team to rest and recuperate) 

Engage in our ‘Vibe Tribe’ - led by our team members; you can contribute to company-wide initiatives directly. Regular events and social activities, fundraising & cause-related campaigns... you name it. We're willing to make it happen!

Team member Assistance Program to proactively support our team's health and wellbeing - access to coaching, education modules, weekly webinars, and more.

16 weeks paid Parental Leave for primary carers and 4 weeks paid Parental Leave for secondary carers

Work with a driven, fun, and switched-on team that likes to raise the bar in all we do.
