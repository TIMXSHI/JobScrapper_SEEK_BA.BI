At Judo, we're more than just a business bank – we're pioneers in redefining business banking for the modern era. Rooted in timeless values such as integrity, trusted relationships, and a challenger spirit, we're dedicated to revolutionising business banking for Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) across Australia. Our journey began in 2016 with a bold vision and a PowerPoint slide, driven by a desire to challenge the status quo in an industry dominated by the major players. In just a few short years, we've grown exponentially, establishing ourselves as one of the fastest-growing new banks globally, with 27 offices spanning the nation.

At the heart of our ethos lies a commitment to supporting Australian SMEs, placing our people and customers front and centre in everything we do. Our agility and adaptability enable us to say 'yes' when other banks say 'no', making it easier for our customers to secure the funding they need, precisely when they need it. We take immense pride in our personal approach to banking, fostering diverse relationships and cultivating a collaborative culture within our team.

Our culture – come and join a multi-award-winning place to work

We firmly believe that culture eats strategy for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and the most important investment we can make is in our people. Our Values of trust, teamwork, accountability and performance underpin the foundation of our culture.

We're not your average bank. Judo was built from the ground up, with one purpose: to be the most trusted SME business bank in Australia. We made sure to cultivate a space where bureaucracy is left at the door - where our customers come first with relationships at the core of what we do. We aspire to think differently, inviting new ideas, and creating a space where everyone feels like they belong because we know that it's our unique differences that make us collectively stronger.

We are thrilled to be externally recognised for our unique culture too! We were awarded the #1 ranking in LinkedIn’s Top Companies in Australia list as well as named in the AFR’s BOSS Best Places To Work list for 3 years in a row. We’re also super proud to be included in the 2024 HRD Australia 5-Star Employers of Choice list and officially be Great Place To Work Australia certified!

Our people and our culture are truly our secret sauce.




Now, about this role…

In this role, you will work closely with the credit models team to design, enhance, and monitor credit risk models that are critical to Judo’s risk quantification and decision-making frameworks. Your work will directly support regulatory capital, provisioning, and internal credit risk assessment, helping to ensure models are both analytically robust and aligned with the dynamics of SME lending. 

You’ll also contribute to the continual refinement of Judo’s quantitative modelling capabilities and play a key role in embedding advanced analytics into credit risk strategies and systems. Beyond model development, you will help optimise credit risk processes and ensure model outputs are effectively leveraged to support the bank’s broader strategic and commercial objectives. 

If that excited you, then this opportunity might just be your dream job:  

Engage with cross-functional stakeholders to ensure model outputs support strategic business objectives and regulatory commitments. 
Contribute to the optimisation of end-to-end modelling processes, improving efficiency, transparency, and integration into broader credit risk workflows. 
Perform deep-dive analysis of portfolio trends to support model assumptions, segmentation, and strategy development. 
Drive the development, monitoring, and refinement of credit risk models across regulatory capital, provisioning, and internal risk frameworks. 
Design and implement methodological improvements to strengthen model accuracy, interpretability, and compliance with regulatory expectations. 
Work collaboratively to align modelling activities with Judo’s credit risk appetite, ensuring models are fit-for-purpose and responsive to portfolio changes. 



A little bit about you…

Your life pre-Judo and the skills you’ve picked up along the way:

A degree in a quantitative discipline such as Statistics, Econometrics, Actuarial Science, Data Science, or Quantitative Finance, with a focus on credit risk or model development. 
Proven experience in the end-to-end development of quantitative models, including data extraction, feature engineering, modelling, validation, and documentation. 
Strong working knowledge of statistical programming languages such as R and/or Python; familiarity with version control tools and reporting via Power BI is a plus. 
Prior exposure to credit risk modelling (PD, LGD, EAD), model monitoring, or validation in a banking or regulatory environment. 
Excellent communication and collaboration skills and the ability to explain technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. 

At Judo, our culture sets us apart. 

Our Values: 

Accountability: Make decisions and own them. Do what you say. 
Performance: Strive to improve each day, surpassing yesterday's achievements. 
Teamwork: We're not just a team; we're a champion team. 
Trust: The cornerstone of our purpose and relationships. 

We're seeking individuals who embody resilience, positivity, curiosity, hunger for success, adaptability, passion, courage, decisiveness, and a hands-on approach. 

What our team members say about us: 

Our people are empowered to make decisions, take ownership, and contribute to a collaborative environment. Bureaucracy is non-existent as we focus on collective success. At Judo, diversity isn't just valued; it's celebrated. We're committed to creating an inclusive environment where everyone thrives, making us collectively stronger.
