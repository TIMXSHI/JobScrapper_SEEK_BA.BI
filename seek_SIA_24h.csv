But in your current role, perhaps you feel boxed in - solving the same problems, working with legacy tools, and not given the platform to influence the bigger change you know is possible.

This is your chance to step into a leadership role where you’ll guide both stability today and transformation tomorrow. You’ll lead a capable team of application specialists with deep domain expertise while helping drive the shift from fragmented, legacy systems to modern, vendor-led platforms. It’s a hands-on position where your technical knowledge, leadership ability, and business engagement skills will all be tested and valued.

The organisation is on a journey: long-standing in-house applications are being phased out in favour of modern supply chain platforms. It’s a role that blends continuity and change, ensuring critical systems remain stable and reliable, while championing the adoption of new solutions that improve efficiency, integration, and customer outcomes.

What you’ll do

Lead and coordinate the day-to-day support of core supply chain applications (covering logistics, inventory, planning, and dispatch systems).
Act as the senior escalation point for critical incidents, providing hands-on investigation, diagnosis, and resolution.
Partner with business users (planners, coordinators, operations managers) to identify issues, deliver enhancements, and support process improvements.
Manage system upgrades, patches, and new features, ensuring testing, communication, and minimal disruption.
Mentor and guide a small, highly experienced team, encouraging knowledge sharing and continuous improvement.
Contribute to the long-term transformation program: helping transition away from legacy systems, supporting integration with modern platforms, and ensuring applications evolve with business needs.




What you’ll bring

10+ years’ application support experience, including at least 5 in supply chain or related operational systems.
Strong technical foundations: SQL, data flow analysis, troubleshooting, and system integrations.
Proven experience leading small teams while remaining hands-on and technically engaged.
Excellent communication and stakeholder management skills, with the ability to front the business and influence decisions.
Familiarity with ITIL practices and ITSM tools (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira).
Background in logistics, distribution, or manufacturing environments will be highly regarded.




Why this role

Impact now, shape the future: balance operational reliability with leading a platform transformation journey.
High visibility: supply chain systems are business-critical, your contribution will be recognised.
Lead experts: inherit and guide a team with deep domain knowledge and help them adapt to change.
Transformation journey: play a key role in shifting from legacy applications to modern, integrated platforms that support efficiency and growth.
