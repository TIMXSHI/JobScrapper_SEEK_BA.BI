Director Level | Consulting

Our client, a high-growth global consulting firm, is seeking a commercially minded Market Solutions Director to sit at the intersection of sales and delivery.
This is not a traditional sales role, and it’s not a delivery lead position. It’s a shaping role, focused on identifying early stage opportunities, navigating ambiguity, and selling integrated, outcome-led solutions rather than point platforms.

What you’ll do:

• Shape loosely defined opportunities into funded engagements
• Lead consultative client conversations and discovery workshops
• Sell business outcomes (CX, transformation, operating model) — not products
• Orchestrate cross-capability solutions across strategy, technology and delivery
• Convert diagnostics and early-stage engagements into material downstream work

What we’re looking for:


Strong consulting background with delivery, credibility
Experience selling complex services engagements
Enough technical depth to be credible in senior conversations
Commercially astute, outcome-focused and comfortable operating at Director level
Ideally some Salesforce experience.
If you thrive in ambiguity, enjoy shaping demand upstream, and want to influence how integrated consulting solutions are taken to market, this is a standout opportunity."
