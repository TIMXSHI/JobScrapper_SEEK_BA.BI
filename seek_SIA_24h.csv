We are looking for a technically robust BI Analyst to join a critical program of work within a major Australian Telecommunications leader.

This is not a standard reporting role. This role requires a hybrid talent who is comfortable spending 80% of their time curating data and building the ""Gold Layer"" in Databricks, and the remaining 20% delivering high-impact visualizations.

You will be responsible for the ongoing maintenance of tactical reporting dashboards that track critical compliance obligations. Your insights will directly flag potential non-compliance and drive business improvements.



12 Month Contract with extensions.
$700 - $750 including super per day.

Data Curation & ETL: Use advanced SQL and Databricks to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from various organizational platforms to create a clean consumption layer.

Dashboard Maintenance: Maintain and optimize existing dashboards (Power BI & Tableau) ensuring absolute accuracy in regulatory reporting.

Insight Generation: Go beyond the numbers-explore base datasets to find the ""truth,"" identify errors, and tell a data-led story to non-technical stakeholders regarding compliance and risk.

Stakeholder Engagement: Translate complex business requirements into technical data solutions, acting as the bridge between the business and the technical data team.


What You Need to Succeed

Advanced SQL Skills: You must be able to write complex queries from scratch.

Databricks Experience: Proven experience working within Databricks is essential.

Visualisation Tools: Strong proficiency in Power BI (primary) and Tableau.

Communication: You have the ""soft skills"" to explain complex technical data to non-technical business leaders clearly.


Highly Desirable:

Experience with Microsoft Fabric.

Previous experience in Telco, Banking, or highly regulated enterprise environments.



Why Apply?

Long-term Stability: A solid 12-month contract with a high likelihood of extension as the project moves from tactical to strategic solutions.

Competitive Rate: Strong daily rate on a PAYG basis.

Immediate Start: We are moving fast to secure talent before the holiday shutdown.

Urgent Requirement: We are shortlisting immediately with a submission deadlinethis week.
