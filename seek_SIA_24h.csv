This ASX-listed organisation is known for its stability, strong governance, and people-centred culture. You’ll be joining a group with a significant national footprint, a top-tier team of professionals, and a culture that values collaboration, integrity, and long-term career growth.

The Role

In this role, you will operate at the core of project analytics, financial modelling and reporting accuracy. You’ll work closely with project and operational teams to ensure data integrity, strengthen financial capability across the development function and provide insights that support senior leadership and board-level decision-making. The work is hands-on, varied and commercially meaningful.

Key Responsibilities

• Develop and refine financial models including cash flow, P&L, balance sheet and scenario analysis.
• Deliver accurate reporting, forecasting and budget inputs across multiple development portfolios.
• Support and coach Development Managers and junior project staff on financial terminology and assumptions.
• Review and enhance system modules and data inputs within internal platforms (Excel, Power Query and BI tools).
• Provide clear, commercially minded insights in a collaborative, people-focused environment.

About You

• Strong financial modelling capability with advanced Excel skill (Power BI, Power Query very beneficial).
• Experience in financial analysis or commercial finance within project-based or complex operating environments.
• Confident educating and influencing non-financial stakeholders.
• High attention to detail and accuracy, with the ability to operate effectively in a lean, fast-paced team.
• A warm, low-ego communication style aligned to a people-centric culture.

Why This Role Stands Out

• A compelling opportunity for technically strong, commercially minded finance professionals seeking genuine influence.
• High-impact involvement in shaping project outcomes and partnering closely with senior leaders.
• Key role in lifting financial capability across development teams.
• For property-experienced candidates: broader exposure, deeper ownership of modelling and cross-state collaboration.
• For candidates from other industries: an opportunity to apply analytical strengths while learning a project-driven sector within a supportive, well-established finance team.
• Join a values-led group with a people-first culture, collaborative national team, flexible working arrangements and a strong suite of benefits.
