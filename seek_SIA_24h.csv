Support budgeting and forecasting timetables, partnering with finance teams and business partners to build accurate, forward-looking views.
Enhance financial models and Power BI dashboards, driving automation and consistent reporting in partnership with systems teams.
Respond to ad hoc analysis and executive queries, including owners and government.
Identify and lead process improvements across reporting and analytics to reduce manual effort and lift quality and speed.

Your experience

Proven experience as a Senior Analyst (FP&A/financial analysis) in a large or complex environment, producing executive-level insights.
Strong accounting foundation with a tertiary finance/accounting degree and CA/CPA (or equivalent).
Recent hands on with Oracle EPM (FCCS/PBCS), advanced Excel, and Power BI.
Exceptional written and verbal communication; able to translate complex data into clear narratives for senior stakeholders.
