Build and own the AI engine that powers a fast‑moving wholesale operation – from warehouse floor to sales pipeline – turning messy, manual processes into a single, living “source of truth” that everyone can see, trust and act on.

What you’ll be doing
Audit, map, improve. Spend your first 30 days embedded with sales, operations and logistics, pulling apart workflows, spotting “time leaks” and designing AI‑driven fixes that actually ship, not sit in slide decks.
Build the “Dashboard of Truth.” Design and deploy real‑time dashboards (Power BI/custom) wired into Harmonic ERP so every role has a live scorecard, clear KPIs, and forward‑looking trends instead of rear‑view reports.
Supercharge sales and logistics. Create tools that point sales to the right customers at the right time, and help logistics move high‑volume perishables with maximum speed, minimal waste and fewer surprises.
Tame the wild GPTs. Take DIY AI tools created by managers, and rebuild them into a secure, governed, shared framework using Confluence and centralised AI services – same creativity, less chaos.
Own the wholesale ChatBot. Design, build and continuously train a 24/7 client ChatBot that can answer complex product, availability and logistics questions without losing the human tone the brand is known for.
Be the “Tomorrow Team.” Scan the AI landscape, experiment with new tools, and bring only the ones that move real metrics – efficiency, margin, accuracy, customer experience – into production.
The kind of person this will suit
Fluent in “business” and “code.” You can sit in a sales meeting, hear a vague problem, and translate it into data models, workflows and prompts – then go away and quietly make it real.
Hands‑on builder. Comfortable in Python for AI/automation, SQL for getting clean data out of the ERP, and Power BI (or similar) for turning that into visual narratives teams actually use.
Systems thinker. You see end‑to‑end flows across sales, inventory, operations and finance, and design AI interventions that work across the whole system, not just one screen.
Logistics‑curious. You don’t need flower experience, but high‑volume, time‑sensitive product and the puzzle of getting it to the right client at exactly the right moment genuinely excites you.
High‑energy starter. You like being the first in, building a function almost from scratch, setting standards, and proving value quickly with visible wins.
What’s on offer
Real ownership. This isn’t “internal IT” or “BI reporting.” You’ll architect the AI and data layer that underpins how the entire business sells, buys, moves and serves.
Salary on offer. Circa $100 - $120k + super but open to discussion for the ""AI guru""
Flex that respects adults. Full‑time role with genuine flexibility in hours and location, plus a regular in‑person rhythm: weekly team time and quarterly strategy days in West Leederville.
Strategy seat. You’ll be at the table for quarterly strategy, shaping how AI supports growth, customer experience and operational excellence over the next 3–5 years.
Industry with heart. You’ll be working in an environment built around creativity, relationships and helping floral businesses thrive – with a team that cares about partnership as much as product.
How to know if you should throw your hat in

If you’ve ever looked at a business and thought, “With clean data, a couple of well‑chosen models, and some decent dashboards, this place would run completely differently,” this is your blank canvas.

Tell me (briefly) about one workflow you transformed with data or AI, what it looked like before, what you built, and the measurable shift it created. Then attach your CV and hit apply.

If you have some questions before applying feel free to call me, Andrew (the guy up the top of the ad) on 08 6140 1800 and we can have a confidential chat."

Develop communications and media frameworks that connect brand objectives to channel choices
Design multi-media campaign architectures spanning video, audio, OOH, sponsorships, print, social, influencer, digital and emerging channels
Apply core marketing principles (e.g. Ehrenberg-Bass, How Brands Grow, IPA effectiveness thinking) to real-world planning decisions
Balance brand-building and performance marketing, ensuring the right mix, scale and investment over time
Partner closely with investment, activation and analytics teams to ensure strategy translates cleanly into delivery
Lead measurement thinking, including incrementality, attribution, regression and effectiveness analysis
Build trusted, senior client relationships through clarity, confidence and commercial acumen
Drive thought leadership through playbooks, frameworks, audience work and business reviews

Experience We Need:

Extensive experience leading media strategy and planning in an agency environment
Deep understanding of both traditional and digital media, and how they work together
Strong grounding in marketing science and effectiveness frameworks (Ehrenberg-Bass, IPA, Nielsen, etc.)
Confidence working across reach, frequency, budget sufficiency and channel roles
Experience building clear, logical frameworks that simplify complexity for clients and teams
A sharp analytical mind, paired with strong storytelling and presentation skills
The ability to influence without ego and lead without hierarchy
Commercial thinking and a practical mindset — strategy that actually gets bought and built
Why This Role
You’ll have genuine influence over how strategy is defined and applied, not just presented
You’ll work in a truly integrated environment, free from channel silos
You’ll help shape marketing that values long-term growth, effectiveness and creativity, not just short-term metrics
You’ll partner with senior clients who want strategic leadership, not just execution
If you believe the best marketing is broad-reach, insight-led and media-neutral, and you want to build work that stands up to both commercial scrutiny and effectiveness science, this role will feel like home."
