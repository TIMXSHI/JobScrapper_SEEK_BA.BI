What Sets You Apart

You’re someone who knows data governance inside out and loves making it practical, not just theoretical. With a solid foundation in the principles and standards that keep data safe and useful, you’re confident working with senior stakeholders and influencing decisions. You will also have experience working with one or more popular data governance tools (Informatica, Collibra, Alation etc) along with hands on implementation of the same across an enterprise landscape.

Communication is your superpower - you can turn technical jargon into plain language and bring people on the journey. Above all, you’re collaborative, solutions-focused and ready to lead initiatives that make a real impact. You’ll also have:
