Lead complex modelling. Shape funding reform. Stay hands-on.
Are you an experienced health economist who wants to lead meaningful work – without disappearing into corporate hierarchy?

At HealthConsult, we’re seeking a Manager – Health Economics to join our growing Financial & Economic Analysis (FEA) service line.

This is a senior, hands-on role. You will lead complex economic modelling, costing, pricing and funding reform projects while mentoring others and helping grow one of Australia’s leading specialist health advisory firms.

About the Role:

As a Manager at HealthConsult, you’ll contribute to projects shaping the future of Australia’s health, aging and disability systems. You will lead and deliver complex economic modelling, costing studies, and pricing or funding reform projects end-to-end, ensuring analytical rigour and real-world policy relevance. You will be accountable for defensible methods, transparent assumptions and audit-ready outputs suitable for senior government decision-making. Your day-to-day work will involve conducting and overseeing financial and economic analysis, developing business cases, and designing cost collection methods, pricing frameworks, or funding models to support major policy and investment decisions.

You will design and implement cost–benefit analyses, cost-effectiveness studies, and pricing models aligned to relevant Treasury guidance, developing robust counterfactuals and, where appropriate, applying quasi-experimental approaches (for example, difference-in-differences, interrupted time series or matching) with clear diagnostics and limitations. You will conduct sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of key assumptions and results. Importantly, you will remain hands-on in modelling - using R, Stata, Python, SQL and/or advanced Excel - ensuring technical quality, reproducibility and clear documentation while guiding the overall analytical strategy. You will oversee modelling quality assurance, version control and structured documentation of assumptions.

Working collaboratively within multidisciplinary teams, you’ll help design and apply robust health economic methods to complex service systems—developing evaluation frameworks, defining appropriate comparators and counterfactuals, and identifying data sources that enable cost, outcome and value analysis. You will contribute to the generation and synthesis of economic evidence that informs resource allocation, pricing and funding decisions across health, ageing and disability.

Managing multiple concurrent projects, you’ll ensure high-quality delivery within scope, time, and budget constraints - often working on initiatives that affect millions of Australians accessing our care systems. As part of your leadership responsibilities, you’ll mentor junior analysts and emerging consultants, building technical capability and confidence across the team. You’ll also contribute to proposal development and the growth of our economic and funding reform service line, helping to position HealthConsult at the forefront of evidence-based policy implementation and sector reform.

This role may involve occasional interstate travel.

About You:

People will likely describe you as having the right blend of technical skills and commercial acumen.

You will also bring:

A Master’s (or higher) in health economics, economics or a related discipline
6–8 years’ experience in consulting, government or applied economic analysis
Demonstrated experience leading cost–benefit, pricing and/or funding reform analyses
Deep experience in complex modeling and data analyses
Experience supervising and mentoring junior analysts
The ability to explain complex modelling clearly to non-technical audiences

Most importantly, you care about impact. You want your work to inform real decisions in health, ageing, and disability.

Eligibility: You must be an Australian citizen at the time an offer of employment is made.

About Us

We specialise in the health, ageing and disability systems and for over 20 years, we have provided evidence-based advice to governments, insurers, health services and care providers. Our multidisciplinary team - spanning clinicians, economists, scientists, and more - works with clients to solve complex sector challenges.

With over 500 projects delivered, from $80K to $17M, we specialise in policy, program evaluation, financial and economic analysis, and digital health. Our Partners and Directors are hands-on, dedicating over half of all consulting hours to mentorship and project guidance.

We’re small by design (and free from large organisation hierarchy). More opportunities to work alongside senior experts. More opportunities to see your ideas through to fruition. And a guarantee that your hard work will be recognised.

We understand that flexibility matters when considering your next role. Let us know your requirements, and we’ll carefully consider how we might accommodate them.

Ready to make a real impact?

This role sits at the centre of Alinta Energy’s strategic decision‑making, supporting the Corporate Strategy team during a period of growth, integration and transformation. It is not a traditional accounting or reporting role - instead, it’s designed for someone with 3-5+ years’ experience who enjoys strategic analysis, commercial thinking and contributing to enterprise‑wide decisions.

You’ll work across a broad and changing set of priorities, including assessing investment opportunities, supporting capital allocation decisions and contributing to long‑term planning. A key part of the role involves using and maintaining the corporate model and five‑year business plan to test scenarios, evaluate options and support executive decision‑making, while coordinating inputs from stakeholders across the business.

With regular exposure to senior leaders and visibility across Retail, Merchant Energy, Power Generation and Finance, this role is ideal for someone early‑to‑mid career from a corporate strategy, consulting or commercial analysis background.

What you’ll do

Assess investment opportunities and capital allocation options aligned to business strategy
Maintain and use the corporate model and five‑year business plan to test strategic scenarios
Undertake scenario, portfolio and competitor analysis to inform executive decision‑making
Support enterprise‑wide strategic initiatives through commercial analysis and stakeholder coordination

Strong understanding of corporate finance and financial evaluation, rather than statutory reporting
Advanced Excel and PowerPoint skills, with the ability to synthesise analysis into executive‑level insights

Please note this role requires full working rights within Australia.

This role is best suited to a commercially minded individual who thrives in a fast‑moving, complex environment and enjoys applying analysis to strategic decision‑making.
