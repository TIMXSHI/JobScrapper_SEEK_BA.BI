What you’ll do

Reporting to the General Manager Enterprise Applications, you’ll manage, develop, and support a suite of core enterprise systems.

You’ll sit at the heart of the interface between internal functional leaders and external vendors, ensuring systems are stable, integrated, and continuously improving.

It’s a hands-on role with variety and visibility. You’ll solve issues, optimise data flows, and collaborate with product owners to deliver enhancements that lift performance, reliability, and user experience.
