We’re Virgin Australia.

We’re the airline that’s always done things a little different. Our way. The Virgin way.

We’re on a mission to make flying better than ‘nice’. And to do that, it takes a team of talented people who are passionate about customer experience, doing the right thing always, with a focus on safety – in the air, on the ground and in our workplaces. A team who values real diversity and inclusion, in a big brand with big ambitions.

What you’ll be doing

We’re looking for an Ancillary Product & Strategy Specialist to help us grow the products our guests love. This role sits within our Revenue Management team and reports to the Senior Manager, Ancillary Product & Strategy. You’ll be part of a team that’s shaping the future of our product portfolio – from strategy and performance reporting to proposition evolution and BAU product management.

You’ll work across the business to support the development of our 3-year product strategy and roadmap, dive deep into data to uncover insights, and help bring new ideas to life. You’ll also get to see the impact of your work every time you fly with us – because what you do will help make our guests’ experience even better.

You’ve got experience in strategy, consulting or commercial analytics, and you’re comfortable working with ambiguity. You know your way around Excel and PowerBI, and you’re confident communicating with stakeholders at all levels.

You’re curious, collaborative, and love solving problems. You’re not afraid to challenge the status quo and bring fresh ideas to the table. And you care about doing things the right way – with integrity, attention to detail, and a focus on impact.

To be considered, you’ll need:

A relevant Bachelor’s degree
2+ years’ experience in strategy/management consulting or similar commercial analytics roles
Strong skills in data analysis, insight generation, and stakeholder communication
Advanced Excel and PowerBI (or similar tools)
