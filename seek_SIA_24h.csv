Other social media work exists to shape behaviour over time.

This role is the second kind.

It’s about understanding audiences deeply enough to influence direction before momentum sets in. About forming hypotheses, designing programs, and staying close to execution long enough to see what actually happens, not just what was intended.

We’re looking for someone senior who wants that mix. Someone comfortable owning the thinking and the doing. Someone who sees execution not as a step down from strategy, but as the fastest way to learn, refine judgement, and build work that compounds.

This role exists because the social media work we do is designed to change outcomes, not just generate activity. That only happens when strategy, programming, and execution are tightly linked and allowed to evolve.

You’ll be working with a multidisciplinary team that includes content strategists, designers, developers, and video production. Social here doesn’t sit on the edge. It’s designed alongside everything else, with shared ownership and shared accountability.

The role, plainly

You’ll be responsible for leading social media strategy and execution across campaigns, programs, and project-based work.

You’ll shape direction early, design social programs deliberately, and stay close to execution so learning isn’t lost in translation. This is a hands-on role. Seniority here means making the calls, doing the work that matters, and knowing when restraint is the more brilliant move.

You won’t be doing community management. You will be designing, programming, and executing social activities with a clear purpose and a long-term view.

You’ll work closely with analysts, creatives, and clients while ideas are still forming. You’ll help decide what’s worth doing, what’s worth testing, and what’s not worth the effort at all.

What you’ll actually be doing

Shaping social media strategy as part of broader promotional and audience work

Designing and executing social programs and campaigns, staying close enough to the work to see the signal early

Programming social activity over time so learning compounds rather than resets

Working with analysts and researchers to combine qualitative and quantitative insight into clear points of view

Collaborating closely with designers, developers, and video teams so social work is built, not bolted on

Making considered calls about formats, cadence, channels, and sequencing

Helping clients understand trade-offs, risks, and likely outcomes across different approaches

Adjusting direction as evidence emerges, without chasing noise or novelty

This work involves ambiguity, iteration, and judgement. Principal ownership means being comfortable making informed calls without pretending everything is certain.

You will need

A strong track record in senior social media roles, with experience owning both strategy and execution

Evidence that you’ve designed and run social programs or campaigns, not just contributed to them

A scientific mindset. You’re comfortable forming hypotheses, testing them, and changing course based on evidence

Confidence working closely with clients and multidisciplinary teams

The ability to explain your reasoning clearly, including uncertainty and trade-offs

Good judgement about when execution adds value and when it doesn’t

If you’re looking for a role focused on community management, reactive posting, or short-term trend chasing, this won’t be the right fit.

Non-negotiables

You have the right to work in Australia

You work onsite from our Richmond office, with hybrid flexibility

This is a full-time role

The organisations we work with tend to be thoughtful, considered, and serious about the consequences of what they put into the world. The problems are rarely flashy, and the work is seldom trivial.

If the appeal of this role is rapid churn, trend-led promotion, or pushing products that don’t ask much of you, it probably won’t hold your attention for long.

You’ll probably enjoy this role if

You like owning both direction and delivery

You’re interested in behaviour, incentives, and how change actually happens

You value work that compounds over time rather than peaks quickly

You’re comfortable holding multiple possible futures in mind at once

You care about quality, judgement, and long-term impact more than volume

Extra credit, not essentials

Formal training or deep practical exposure to behavioural science, psychology, economics, sociology, or a closely related field

Experience working with statistical analysis, modelling, or quantitative research, even if not as a primary analyst

Experience working inside genuinely multidisciplinary teams where influence matters more than authority

Working at August

Working at August is deliberate. It’s not chaotic, and it’s not rigid. It’s designed to give experienced people room to do their best work without unnecessary friction.

We’re building something here. Not in a rush, and not for scale at any cost, but with intent. We want our work to influence how organisations make decisions, not just how they market themselves. That ambition shapes the problems we take on and the standard we expect of the work.

You’ll have a high degree of autonomy, paired with clear expectations about judgement, quality, and follow-through. We care deeply about how decisions are made, not just what gets delivered.

The work is thoughtful and often complex. It rewards people who like to think things through, ask better questions, and take responsibility for outcomes. A sense of play still matters, but it’s grounded in craft and curiosity, not noise.

If this feels worth exploring

The role

We are recruiting for several Business Analyst positions to work across a variety of initiatives and delivery streams within DTS. These roles offer the opportunity to contribute to complex, meaningful initiatives and services that enhance the experience of students, staff, and the broader University community. As a Business Analyst, you will play a critical role in bridging the gap between business needs and digital solutions, supporting the full lifecycle of business and system improvement initiatives—from discovery and requirements definition through to solution design, testing, implementation, and post-delivery optimisation.

You will work closely with stakeholders, end-users, and delivery teams to analyse requirements, optimise processes, and contribute to the successful delivery of user-centred solutions in a dynamic higher education environment.

What you’ll do:

Engage with stakeholders through workshops, interviews, and consultations to understand business needs and document clear, fit-for-purpose requirements
Translate business requirements into functional and non-functional specifications that guide solution design and delivery
Collaborate with technical and delivery teams to design and validate solutions aligned with enterprise standards and organisational objectives
Analyse current processes and systems, identify gaps, and recommend improvements that deliver measurable business value
Support solution testing activities, including test case development and user acceptance testing coordination
Contribute to project planning, estimation, scheduling, and governance activities
Maintain high-quality documentation such as process maps, user stories, system specifications, and change artefacts
Support implementation and post-go-live activities, including issue resolution, benefits realisation, and continuous improvement
Build strong relationships across business and technical teams to ensure shared understanding and effective communication

These full-time positions are fixed term for up to 2 years and located onsite at Callaghan Campus. 

About you
You are a proactive and consultative Business Analyst who enjoys working across varied initiatives and stakeholder groups. You bring:
Proven experience in business analysis within digital, systems, or process improvement environments
Strong stakeholder engagement and facilitation skills, with the ability to translate complex needs into clear outcomes
Experience working within project or delivery frameworks, including agile, hybrid, or waterfall methodologies
A user-centred mindset with a focus on improving experience and service outcomes
Strong analytical, documentation, and communication skills
