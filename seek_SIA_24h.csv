The platforms are in place. ERP is progressing. Microsoft Fabric is live. Reporting has replaced legacy systems. Vendors are engaged. Teams are busy. Yet outcomes still feel effortful. Rework absorbs capacity. Technical debt accumulates. Timelines shift. Senior leaders remain closer to architectural and engineering decisions than they should, simply to keep delivery on track.

The issue is not ambition or capability. It is operational readiness and practice maturity.

Standards vary. Modelling discipline is inconsistent. Architectural ownership is fragmented. Decisions are sometimes made reactively or too locally. Good people are working hard, but delivery is not yet operating like a well-oiled machine. It is not yet predictable or repeatable.

You can see what it could look like. Clear enterprise principles. Defined architectural accountability. Strong data modelling standards across Fabric. Vendors guided properly. Engineering and integration teams operating under disciplined patterns. Work flowing from design through to BAU with fewer surprises and less rework.

This role exists to build exactly that level of maturity.

Why This Role Exists

This organisation is a high-growth, omni-channel national retailer operating across stores, supply chain, manufacturing, and ecommerce in a live trading environment.

Over time, it has built a complex technology ecosystem spanning ERP, POS, WMS, ecommerce, integration, and data platforms. Significant investment has been made in Microsoft Fabric and analytics capability. AI and machine learning use cases are emerging, but sustainable value depends on stronger modelling discipline and architectural governance.

The constraint is not tooling. It is readiness.

Practice maturity across engineering, data, and architecture has not kept pace with platform investment. Some design decisions require rework. Modelling standards need tightening. Vendors require clearer guardrails. Senior leadership bandwidth is being absorbed compensating for gaps.

The mandate is clear:

Lift data platform maturity and modelling discipline within Fabric
Strengthen engineering and integration standards
Establish enterprise architectural ownership across platforms
Reduce rework and technical debt through stronger upfront design
Build a predictable, repeatable technology practice that scales

Architecture is not an add-on in this role. It sits squarely within your remit. You will own the architectural lens across engineering, data, and integration, ensuring decisions align to enterprise standards and scale with the business.

The Role

This is a senior leadership role, but it is not an ivory tower.

You will lead engineering, data, and architecture across internal capability and third-party partners. You will not be hired as the deepest technical expert in the room. You are hired to mature the way the room operates.

You will:

Define and enforce architectural principles and decision frameworks
Own enterprise architectural oversight across platforms, integration, and data
Uplift Microsoft Fabric practices, including modelling, pipelines, documentation, and governance
Improve engineering discipline across .NET and integration teams
Govern vendor delivery to ensure extensibility, security, and supportability
Reduce delivery rework by embedding stronger design and readiness standards
Act as the senior escalation point for complex technical and architectural trade-offs
Partner closely with the Head of Technology Delivery to ensure work lands cleanly into BAU

You will stay close enough to delivery to ask the right questions, challenge assumptions, and validate decisions, while maintaining the leadership altitude required to embed repeatable behaviour.

Environment and Context

National retailer operating in live trading conditions
Microsoft Fabric analytics environment supporting enterprise reporting and AI readiness
Active ERP and integration uplift across supply chain and digital platforms
Digital delivery cadence is strong, engineering and data practices require maturity uplift
Based at the South West Sydney head office, four days on site Monday to Thursday, with the option to work from home on Fridays

This is not greenfield. It is not broken. It is a partially mature environment that requires focused leadership to become predictable, disciplined, and scalable.

What You’ll Bring

You are a practice uplifter.

You are likely someone who started close to technology, possibly in development, data, integration, or systems roles, and broadened into leadership positions where your value came from lifting how teams operate rather than being the most specialised technical expert in the room.

You will bring:

Experience leading data or engineering teams through maturity transitions
Strong grounding in data platforms and modelling within Microsoft analytics environments
Enough architectural and software engineering depth to challenge vendors and guide standards without building solutions yourself
A track record of walking into low-maturity environments and making them materially better
The ability to embed repeatable principles, patterns, and governance across teams
Commercial judgement around AI and analytics investment, focusing on meaningful value rather than experimentation for its own sake

This is a highly visible role with broad exposure across the business and the opportunity to shape engineering, data, and architecture practice in a complex retail environment.

Job Description


About the Group/Team

The Editing Platform group sits within the Design Experience supergroup and powers the foundations that enable anyone, anywhere, to create beautiful designs with speed and confidence. We build secure, performant, reliable, and scalable platform capabilities that support Canva’s editor and unlock powerful new product experiences.

Within this group, the Design Import team is focused on making it effortless for users to bring their designs into Canva from external tools and formats. We work at the intersection of rendering systems, file parsing, performance engineering, and user experience — ensuring that imported designs are accurate, editable, and production-ready. Our work plays a critical role in reducing friction for new users and deepening value for teams and enterprises migrating to Canva.

About the Role/Specialty:

As the first Senior Machine Learning Engineer on Design Import, you’ll be pioneering ML capability within the team. You’ll bring conceptual and practical expertise to complex problems and apply machine learning techniques to improve import accuracy, structure recognition, layout reconstruction, and performance optimization.

You’ll work cross-functionally with backend engineers, rendering experts, product managers, and designers to identify high-impact ML opportunities. As the first MLE in the team, you’ll shape strategy, define best practices, and build scalable ML systems that integrate deeply into Canva’s editor platform.

This role is ideal for someone who thrives in ambiguity, enjoys building from first principles, and wants to make foundational impact in a high-scale, product-led environment.

What you’ll do (responsibilities)

Design, build, and deploy machine learning models that improve the accuracy and quality of design imports at scale.

Work closely with engineers to integrate ML systems into high-performance backend and rendering pipelines.

Define data strategies — including data collection, labeling approaches, and evaluation frameworks — to continuously improve model performance.

Take a new perspective on existing import solutions and apply analytical thinking to solve complex, ambiguous problems.

Contribute to architectural decisions that impact the broader Editing Platform ecosystem.

Champion experimentation, monitoring, and model observability best practices.

Collaborate across teams to identify opportunities where ML can unlock step-change improvements in user experience.

What we're looking for:


You’re a strong technical craftsperson who combines deep ML expertise with product intuition. You’re comfortable operating independently and taking ownership of complex problem spaces, while still valuing collaboration and feedback.

We’re looking for someone who:

Has strong experience building and deploying machine learning models in production environments.

Has hands-on experience with Python and ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) and experience shipping scalable systems.

Demonstrates conceptual and practical expertise in areas such as computer vision, document/layout understanding, structured data extraction, or related fields.

Is comfortable navigating ambiguity and shaping problem definitions in a fast-scaling environment.

Thinks beyond model performance — considering system design, latency, reliability, and user impact.

Communicates clearly and can translate complex ML concepts into actionable engineering decisions.
