At BOQ Group, we’re building a simpler, more resilient bank, and strong risk capability is at the heart of that transformation. As a Senior Analyst in Line 1 Risk, you’ll play an important role in helping our teams embed proactive, thoughtful and practical risk management every day. This role is all about empowering the business to make confident decisions that balance opportunity with strong, safe outcomes for our customers and the Group.

You’ll work closely with Business Unit leaders and partner with Group functions to ensure our risk practices align with BOQ Group’s Risk Management Strategy and standards. Your work will help uplift controls, strengthen our risk culture and ensure we’re meeting regulatory expectations. From providing day‑to‑day risk advice to supporting change assessments, designing and enhancing controls, analysing key trends, or assisting with governance and reporting, you’ll be a trusted voice that helps the organisation understand risk and respond to it effectively.

This role is hands‑on and collaborative, and you’ll contribute to activities that support the Group’s control environment, including risk in change assessments, management of issues and events, developing and updating risk profiles, and supporting the delivery of BOQ Group’s remedial actions.

You’re someone who enjoys working in a dynamic environment where risk management genuinely shapes the way we operate. You bring curiosity, strong analytical thinking and a commitment to enabling better outcomes for our customers and our people.

You’re comfortable engaging across different teams, offering clear and pragmatic advice, and supporting stakeholders to understand risks, obligations and controls in a way that feels accessible and constructive.

You communicate clearly, think logically and pay close attention to detail. You enjoy unpacking complex issues, exploring root causes and designing solutions that strengthen control effectiveness. You also value collaboration and take pride in contributing to a positive team culture where continuous improvement is part of how you work.

If you’re looking for a role where you can influence meaningful change, deepen your expertise and help shape the future of risk at BOQ Group, this is an opportunity to make a real impact.
