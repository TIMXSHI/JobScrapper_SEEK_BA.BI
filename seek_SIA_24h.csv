Above market remuneration
Sydney CBD | Permanent role
High performance trading environment

About the role

This is a mid to senior level operations role supporting an active ETF trading desk within a high performance, technically driven environment.

The structure is flat and hands-on. You will report directly into the Head of Operations and have real ownership over day to day outputs, problem solving and interaction with the trading desk. This is not a layered team with narrow responsibilities and constant escalation.

You'll be responsible for owning daily P&L and operational risk, working closely with traders to understand drivers behind movements, investigate issues, and resolve breaks at the root cause level rather than pushing them through a checklist.

This role suits someone who enjoys being challenged, likes understanding how things work under the hood, and is comfortable operating in a fast paced trading setup where expectations are high.

What you'll be doing

· Owning daily P&L production and analysis, including investigation of unexplained movements

· Reconciling positions, cash and trades across internal systems and prime brokers

· Analysing valuation, corporate action impacts, financing and margin movements

· Troubleshooting issues across the trade lifecycle and clearly articulating causes

· Working closely with trading, risk and external counterparties to resolve discrepancies

· Identifying inefficiencies and contributing to process and system improvements

· Supporting expansion into new products, markets or trading strategies

What we're looking for

· 7-9 years' experience in operations, middle office or P&L within trading, market making or ETF environments

· Strong understanding of ETFs and equity derivatives beyond pure process execution

· Comfortable explaining why numbers move, not just reconciling them

· Exposure to valuation, margin, corporate actions and liquidity considerations

· Technically curious, with Python, SQL or VBA experience highly regarded

· Calm under pressure, detail focused and confident engaging with front office stakeholders

What's on offer

· Above market remuneration for the right level of experience

· Direct exposure to a technically sophisticated trading environment

· Flat structure with genuine ownership and accountability"
