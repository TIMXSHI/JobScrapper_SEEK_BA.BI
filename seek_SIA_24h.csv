You’re a proven data leader. You’ve built teams, uplifted capability, and helped business stakeholders see the real value of data. But maybe you’re stuck somewhere overly reactive, under-resourced, or unclear on direction.

You want to lead a function with purpose. You want influence, access, and the opportunity to get it right, not just maintain what’s already there.

This is that role.

You’ll step into an organisation investing heavily in technology, modernisation, and member experience. Data is one of the core pillars of a large transformation program, and you’ll be at the centre of it, shaping the future state, guiding decision-making, and creating a proactive, insight-led data culture.

The role

Reporting to the CIO, you’ll lead a combined team of data engineers and BI specialists, approximately ten people with two direct reports. Your remit spans strategy, architecture, governance, reporting, and capability uplift.

You’ll unite two teams under one operating model, redesign the Microsoft Fabric environment, and establish the frameworks, processes, and standards that will set the company up for long-term success.

You’ll work closely with executives, program leads, and external vendors across a major two-year investment program. This is not a hands-on role, but you’ll need enough depth to guide, challenge, and protect the integrity of the data environment.

The role requires someone who listens first, communicates well, and can translate technical concepts into simple, meaningful business language. Someone who can influence at senior levels without ego. Someone who can build trust quickly.

What you’ll lead

Define the enterprise data and analytics strategy and roadmap.
Bring together data engineering and BI under one clear operating model.
Redesign and uplift the Microsoft Fabric environment.
Oversee data architecture, modelling, pipelines, and integration.
Strengthen data governance, data quality, and stewardship.
Establish an enterprise reporting framework and reduce ad hoc work.
Partner with executives and transformation leaders across all program streams.
Lift organisational data literacy and champion insight-led decision-making

What you’ll bring

Strong experience leading data, BI, or analytics teams.
Deep understanding of Microsoft Fabric, Azure, Power BI, and governance frameworks.
Ability to communicate simply with senior stakeholders.
Experience shaping data strategy and improving enterprise reporting.
Calm, composed leadership style built on listening and clarity; and
A values-aligned approach and genuine interest in building capability

Why now

You’re joining at exactly the right time: the organisation is modernising its entire digital ecosystem, and data is central to the program’s success. There’s clarity of direction, strong executive support, and significant runway to build something meaningful.

You’ll work with a CIO who values communication, leadership presence, and authenticity. You’ll have influence, visibility, and the chance to leave a lasting impact on how data is used across the organisation.

You’ll also join a values-driven, people-centred environment with flexibility, development, and a clear commitment to purpose.

Salary and benefits

$200,000 - $210,000 including superannuation.
Receive not for profit salary packaging benefits.
Hybrid model: three days WFH, two days in office.
Five weeks of paid annual leave including Christmas to New Year closure.
Birthday leave and the ability to purchase additional leave.
Strong focus on learning and professional development.
CBD offices with modern facilities.
