Key Responsibilities

Labour Modeling: support with the build of bottom-up labor budgets for 350+ sites using engineered labour standards.
Insightful Reporting: Create, present, and implement simplified, high-impact reporting to help Operations teams identify anomalies, trends, costs, and efficiency opportunities, as well as drive the link between workforce mix and strategy.

Stakeholder Coaching: Partner with and coach Brand Finance and Operations teams on workforce planning best practices.
Productivity Optimization: Use data to identify performance gaps and support initiatives that make store operations ""simpler.""
Qualifications

Now let’s talk about you: 

Experience: 5 years in operational workforce planning (Retail or Hospitality experience is a huge plus).
Technical Skills: Advanced analytical and modeling skills. Proficiency in SQL and Tableau is essential; experience with Python or cloud platforms (Azure/AWS/GCP) is highly desired.

Business Acumen: The ability to interpret Enterprise Agreements, awards, and wage reporting to drive productivity.
Communication: A knack for presenting data to cross-functional stakeholders in a way that is easy to understand and act upon.
