Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, 你好, hallo, vítejte!
Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

Where and how you can work
Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work, we trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals.

What you'd be doing in this role
As Canva scales, change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

At the moment, this role is focused on:

Leading the development of Infra Analytics data services, ensuring complex infrastructure insights are intuitive and accessible for stakeholders across Canva.

Architecting resilient, high-performance pipelines to orchestrate massive telemetry streams, maintaining the same scalability standards as our production systems.

Driving the technical strategy for data warehouse performance, ensuring efficient query execution and cost-effective storage for large-scale infra datasets.

Defining and promoting data modeling standards across the Infra Supergroup to ensure a unified and disciplined approach to data architecture.

Designing and maintaining a robust Infra semantic layer to guarantee a ""single source of truth"" for metrics and dimensions across all BI and analytical tools.

Partnering with cross-functional teams to lead the delivery of complex, high-impact projects from ideation to production.

Championing engineering best practices, with a focus on performance, scalability, reliability, and code quality.

You're probably a match if:

You have a proven track record of building scalable data solutions to solve complex, high-impact business challenges.

You’re fluent in advanced SQL and bring deep, hands-on experience in modern data modelling.

You’re proficient with Snowflake and AWS, and experienced with data transformation and orchestration tools (e.g. dbt, Airflow).

You are comfortable coding in Python.

You lead with an ownership mindset, communicate with clarity and influence, and thrive in collaborative, fast-moving environments.

A plus if you’re passionate about exploring emerging AI/ML opportunities.
