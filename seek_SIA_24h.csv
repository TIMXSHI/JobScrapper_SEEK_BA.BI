The Opportunity:
Six months ago, this Aussie FinTech made a clear call that AI would not be a side experiment. Since then, they have moved their data estate into Databricks, partnered with a Big Four firm to translate Australian AI standards into a practical risk framework, and shipped their first Gen AI use cases into production.
  
The board has backed a funded roadmap through to 2026 to reinvent customer experience and operations with AI and automation. They are now at an inflection point. The foundations are in place, AI is live, and business demand is growing. Teams across operations, customer experience, procurement and finance want to build their own agents in Copilot Studio.
  
You'll sit alongside the Chief Data and AI Officer and the AI and data squads to turn a detailed risk and governance framework into simple choices for each use case, help non-technical teams design and refine agents, and decide when something is ready to move from the sandbox to production and scale.
  
This role is the bridge between enablement and governance and is critical to scaling AI safely across the organisation.
  
What you’ll do:

Help teams design, build and launch Copilot Studio agents
Administer Copilot Studio, including access, environments and deployments
Turn the AI risk framework into precise, right-sized controls per use case
Monitor AI solutions in production using Databricks and Power BI, building dashboards and alerts
Identify and escalate issues such as model drift, prompt misuse or unexpected outputs
Partner with Engineering, Risk, Security and business leaders so AI stays both fast and safe  
What you bring:

Experience deploying or enabling AI, data or analytics platforms in complex environments
Strong analytical skills, comfortable reading logs, working with observability tools and building dashboards
Hands-on exposure to AI governance, risk, or compliance, ideally aligned to formal standards or frameworks.
Enough technical fluency to talk credibly about topics like RAG, MLflow, model monitoring and prompt risks, even if you are not a pure engineer
Track record working across first and second line style teams, translating policy into practical guardrails in production.
Ability to coach non-technical teams on how to frame use cases, design agents, and make good trade-offs between speed, risk and value
Nice to have: Databricks, MLflow, Power BI, Azure Monitor, RAG or agent-based use cases, and experience in regulated industries such as banking, healthcare or government.
