Use your data skills to drive real community impact in a collaborative, values-driven team while growing in analytics, BI, and data strategy.

 

About 

Join a community-focused organisation that’s using data to drive better decisions and deliver more effective services. It’s a place where people care about the “why” behind the numbers, and where data is used to understand people and improve outcomes, not just to report on them.

You’ll be part of a close-knit team that values collaboration, curiosity, and practical problem solving. They’re connecting systems, improving data quality, and turning insights into actions that genuinely help the business and community.

 

The Opportunity

You’ll join a small, collaborative analytics function reporting into the Manager of Applications. The team is responsible for building a single-client view, improving data quality across multiple systems, and turning operational data into insight that program teams and leaders can act on.

This role suits someone with hands-on experience working with data, someone who has tackled challenging datasets, uncovered insights from imperfect sources, and can work closely with service teams to communicate findings clearly and effectively.

 

What You'll Do

In this role, you’ll translate complex data into actionable insights, support decision-making across the organisation, and work closely with teams to ensure information is accurate, meaningful, and accessible. Your work will combine hands-on analysis with stakeholder collaboration to make data genuinely useful.

Design, build and maintain dashboards and visualisations (Power BI).
Write and optimise SQL for reporting, extraction and transformation.
Pull together data from multiple enterprise systems (Dynamics 365, CRM, HRIS, Payroll, etc.) to support a single client view.
Investigate and improve data quality, validation, cleansing and documentation.
Translate business questions into clear metrics, insights and simple stories for non-technical teams.
Work with IT/engineering teams to support integration and automation of reporting workflows.
Provide guidance and training so teams can use self-service BI effectively.
Contribute to data governance, privacy and compliance practices.
 

What You'll Bring

You’ll bring strong analytical skills and a collaborative, solution-focused approach. The right person can work with complex datasets, communicate insights clearly, and support teams in making informed decisions.

Tertiary qualification in a relevant field (Data Analytics, IS, Computer Science or equivalent experience).
Practical Power BI experience (dashboard design, modelling, DAX).
Strong SQL skills across relational databases.
Experience analysing and joining data from multiple enterprise systems (Dynamics 365, CRM, HRIS, Payroll).
Understanding of data integration / ETL patterns and data quality techniques.
Ability to explain technical findings simply and tell the story behind the numbers.
Collaborative, empathetic approach, works well with program teams and stakeholders.
Curious, problem-solving mindset with a genuine interest in using data for impact.
 

Desirable

Familiarity with Microsoft Azure data services (Data Factory, Synapse).

Knowledge of Power Platform / CDS / Dynamics 365 data architecture.

Experience automating workflows and reporting.

Basic exposure to R/Python or predictive techniques.

Power BI / SQL Server certifications.

 

Why Join Us

Be part of a team where your work directly contributes to better outcomes for the community. You’ll join a collaborative, values-driven environment that encourages curiosity, problem-solving, and continuous learning. The role offers the chance to develop your skills in analytics, BI, and data strategy while seeing the real-world impact of your work.
