The Opportunity

We’re looking for a highly capable, hands-on specialist to lead the integration, improvement, and optimisation of PMA’s business systems with a strong focus on Kynection, workflow design, reporting frameworks, and data accuracy. This is not a people management role. This is a senior, implementation role for someone who enjoys solving problems, whilst building real solutions that will make business sense.

You will work directly with the founding Directors, have autonomy to design and implement improvements, and play a key role in PMA’s operational and digital transformation.

In this well-rounded role, you will develop and deliver integration plans across the business including

• Lead the review, integration, and optimisation of PMA’s business systems (primarily Kynection).

• Analyse and refine workflows across Operations, Reporting, and Finance to ensure accuracy, consistency, and ease of use.

• Build, test, and implement process improvements and automation.

• Develop and maintain PMA’s reporting and business intelligence frameworks, including hands-on dashboard development in Power BI.

• Present clear recommendations, business cases, and options for system or workflow improvements.

• Oversee the rollout of approved changes to ensure smooth adoption and measurable business outcomes.

• Engage directly with Frontline Teams and Managers to understand real-world system usage and user challenges.

• Travel between NSW and QLD as required to support discovery and implementation activities.

About You

You’re a systems-focused professional with strong technical capability and the confidence to take ownership of complex workflows and reporting needs. You enjoy being hands-on and working directly with all employees with both Directors and frontline operators.

You will bring:

• Experience improving or integrating business systems (Kynection, simPRO, MYOB, Upvise, Pronto, or similar).

• Strong ability to break down workflows, map AS-IS processes, and design improved future-state processes.

• Hands-on capability with Power BI, including building dashboards, modelling data, connecting multiple systems, and translating operational data into actionable insights.

• Experience delivering automation, reporting improvements, or workflow simplification.

• Strong communication skills, able to engage Senior Leaders, Supervisors, and Field Teams.

• Solid analytical skills with the ability to turn operational problems into system solutions.

• Willingness to travel between NSW and QLD for discovery, training, and implementation work.

Experience in utilities, maintenance, construction, or service-based industries is highly regarded, but not essential. This role can be based from Ingleburn (NSW) or Stapylton (QLD) or Maroochydore (QLD).

Why PMA?

• A senior role with real autonomy, work with Senior Leaders including founding Directors

• Own the systems, the improvements, and the outcomes

• Flexibility to travel as needed and work independently

• Hands-on position in a business that wants practical results, not layers of complexity

• Major role in a genuine business transformation program

• Supportive team and strong operational culture
