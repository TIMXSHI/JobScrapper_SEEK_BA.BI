Together we’re driving to deliver our vision to provide our customers with financial security for a better retirement.

We achieve this goal by providing a work environment where people from diverse backgrounds, with a range of skills and experiences can contribute and succeed.

Valuations Analyst – Sydney 

We’ve created a brand-new role to strengthen how we independently validate private debt pricing  

Sitting alongside the Quant team, you’ll be the control point that keeps pricing accurate, on time, and defensible.  

If you like being the person who spots issues early, gets the detail right, and keeps everyone honest, this is very much your lane. 

We work flexibly from our Sydney CBD Office (Typically 3 days in office, 2 from home). 

About the role  

You will join a high performing team within the COO Office, which is tightly integrated across our investment teams and collaborates with multiple support functions to drive operational precision and agility. 

Operating alongside the Quantitative team, and functioning as an independent control, you will be central to pricing governance, daily unit pricing, and month-end reporting to the Valuation Committee. 

If you thrive on detail, work well to tight deadlines, and enjoy partnering with portfolio managers and external service providers, this role will suit you perfectly. 

What you’ll be across day-to-day 

Daily operations 

Run pre-9:30am checks on private debt pricing and control reports, digging into variances and data mismatches (think static data, curves, odd gaps). 

Handle price-threshold queries from State Street and our PMs as they come up - and keep things moving 

Book and load trades in Charles River, ironing out any trade-reporting issues before they land in someone else’s inbox. 

Flag issues early with a clear read on impact to unit pricing quality and SLA delivery. 

Month-end and governance: 

Pull together clean, reconciled packs for PMs and the Valuation Committee — and present the private debt reporting. 

Make sure final unit pricing reflects every required valuation within the deadlines. 

Present private debt price reporting to the Valuation Committee and implement directed pricing in internal systems. 

Support semi-annual sensitivity work and any ad-hoc pricing investigations. 

Technical / financial work: 

Maintain and troubleshoot models and reporting using advanced Excel (Power Query, macros, formulas). 

Apply foundational fixed-income knowledge across pricing, derivatives, and cash-flow discounting. 

Skills & experience you will need

You’ve got middle-office or fixed-income operations experience (bank, asset manager, investment admin) and ideally have exposure to private debt instruments. 

As well as;  

Comfort working under strict SLAs and regulatory oversight.  

Experience supporting governance processes (e.g. Valuation Committees) is advantageous 

Advanced Excel skills - (Power Query, macros), data querying and reconciliation. 

Your eye for detail is sharp, and you’re the kind of person who won’t move on until the numbers tie out. 

You communicate clearly, partner well with busy stakeholders, and know when to push back. 

Qualifications 

Bachelor’s degree in finance, Accounting, Economics or equivalent. 

Additional Information 

At Challenger, we’re small enough to be agile, but big enough to accelerate bold ideas. We support your growth and development, offering flexibility and a culture that values your unique contributions. 

Competitive discretionary bonus scheme 

18 weeks paid parental leave for all new parents 

Challenger Day – one extra day off every year in recognition of the effort our people make.
