Market analysis: Monitor and interpret physical, forward, and environmental markets to forecast trends and inform trading decisions, including BESS performance analysis and SEC asset back‑testing.
Reporting: Build and maintain market, position, and contract reports using SQL, Databricks, and PowerBI to support ongoing trading activities.
Spot trading: Provide spot trading coverage and real‑time operational support for SEC‑traded generation and storage assets in the NEM.
Contract management: Support management of offtake and long‑term contracts, including tracking generation availability, meeting reporting requirements, and managing contractual obligations.
Risk and compliance: Help ensure strong governance by monitoring trading activity for compliance with internal and regulatory requirements and escalating potential issues.

Numerical and computing skills to support the development of accessible analytical and reporting tools including Advanced Excel, PowerBI, and/or Tableau.
Excellent attention to detail and data quality discipline (validation, reconciliation and documentation)
Excellent communication skills with internal and external stakeholders and ability to clearly present on outcomes of data analysis

Highly Desirable:

At least a year of experience working in the energy industry ideally in a NEM market participant (retailer/generator/gentailer)
Knowledge of electricity derivative markets and environmental certificate markets
Exposure to long-term/structured energy purchasing agreements and offtakes

Inspires you through meaningful, challenging work in an environment that encourages leadership and an entrepreneurial spirit.
Supports your growth through career advancement and professional development opportunities.
