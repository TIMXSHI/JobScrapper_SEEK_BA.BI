We’re building something new: a smarter, simpler, and more connected advice ecosystem that redefines how advisers and clients experience financial advice. This is your opportunity to take the reins of a new strategy, with executive sponsorship, clear ambition, and the freedom to challenge legacy thinking.

As Head of Advice Technology Strategy, you’ll define and drive the vision for a fit-for-purpose ecosystem that enables advice efficiency, scalability, and growth. You’ll look across the end-to-end advice journey, from adviser tools and client platforms to back-office systems, and design a roadmap that brings it all together.

You’ll partner closely with senior executives and business leaders to translate strategy into action, guiding the design of solutions that deliver measurable business outcomes. This means leveraging modern technology, data, and AI to reduce complexity, automate processes, and unlock adviser capacity, all while enhancing the client experience.

This is a role for a hands-on strategic leader who thrives in ambiguity, connects the dots across business lines, and knows how to turn ideas into execution. You’ll lead and develop a team of product owners and business analysts, fostering a high-performance culture built on collaboration, innovation, and delivery.


What you’ll do
Here’s where you’ll make an impact and shape the future of advice at scale:

·       Define and deliver the Advice Technology Strategy, ensuring it drives efficiency, scalability, and measurable outcomes.

·       Engage deeply with executives and stakeholders to align technology direction to business priorities.

·       Shape the ""continuum of advice"" across digital, intrafund, and comprehensive channels, using data and AI to connect experiences across a client’s lifetime.

·       Develop frameworks, roadmaps, and business cases that translate strategic goals into delivery outcomes.

·       Partner across the enterprise with Advice Enablement, Technology, Architecture, CX, and Product teams to ensure alignment and adoption.

·       Champion a culture of modernisation, straight-through processing, and seamless advice implementation.

·       Build and inspire a high-performing team of product owners and BAs focused on execution and impact.

 

What You Bring to This Role

To be successful, you’ll combine deep industry knowledge with a modern, delivery-focused mindset:

·       Proven leadership in strategy, transformation, or delivery within financial advice, superannuation, or wealth management.

·       Hands-on experience implementing modern technologies that drive advice efficiency and scale.

·       Deep understanding of advice processes, compliance, and regulatory frameworks.

·       Experience developing and executing AI-led strategies for transformational change.

·       Strong stakeholder and executive engagement skills, with the ability to influence, simplify, and deliver at pace.

·       Strategic and commercial acumen, coupled with a customer-first mindset.

·       A start-up mentality within an enterprise setting: pragmatic, collaborative, and outcome-driven.


This is more than just a strategy role. It’s a chance to lead the next evolution of advice technology at scale, backed by a business that’s ready to do things differently.
