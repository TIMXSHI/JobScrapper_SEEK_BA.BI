Role Description

This is an exceptional opportunity for a proactive and hands-on Financial Analyst who thrives on understanding the inner workings of a business. This is not a standard, back office accounting position; it's a high impact, investigative role where you will be instrumental in analysing the operational performance of each individual store. You'll be responsible for deep diving into core cost drivers like wages, overheads, and rent to determine where budgets have been met or exceeded. Your analysis and communication will directly influence critical operational decisions.

This is a permanent, full-time position located at the Sydney Olympic Park office. It offers a competitive salary commensurate with the individual's qualifications and experience.


Key Responsibilities

Conduct in depth analysis of the key operational cost drivers across all stores, including wages, overheads, and rent.
Investigate and analyse labour costs for permanent, part time, and temporary staff to understand performance against budgets.
Prepare and analyse financial results from an operational standpoint, providing clear and concise commentary on variances between actual performance and monthly forecasts.
Communicate key findings and actionable insights to senior leadership and the board, highlighting areas of concern and potential solutions.
Collaborate with operational teams to understand the reasons behind cost overruns, such as rostering inefficiencies.
Contribute to the ongoing development and improvement of financial reporting tools and processes.
Assist in budget and forecast preparations, ensuring accuracy and alignment with operational performance objectives.


Qualifications & Skills

Excellent attention to detail and a robust, adaptable nature.
Strong analytical and problem solving skills, with a focus on investigating underlying drivers.
Exceptional communication skills, both written and verbal, with the ability to present complex financial data to non finance stakeholders.
Advanced proficiency in Excel, SAP, and Power BI.
A flexible and adaptable approach to work in a dynamic, fast paced retail environment.
A relevant bachelor's degree in Finance or Accounting.
A CPA/CA qualification is highly regarded but not essential.


What's on Offer?

A hands on, non BAU role with a focus on investigation and problem solving.
The opportunity to directly influence business decisions and contribute to operational efficiency.
A permanent position with a competitive salary.
The chance to work with a market leader in a growing industry.


If you are a driven Financial Analyst with a passion for investigation and a flair for communication, we want to hear from you.
