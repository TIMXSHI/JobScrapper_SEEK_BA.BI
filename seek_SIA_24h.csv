The purpose of health practitioner regulation is to protect the public by ensuring that only health practitioners who have the skills, qualifications, and knowledge to provide safe care are registered. 

We have a unique opportunity for an exceptional leader to step into complexity, lead with courage, and help shape what comes next, with a fixed term opportunity based in our Melbourne office.

The Chief Data, Analytics, and Insights Officer (CDAIO) is a pivotal enterprise leader responsible for shaping Ahpra’s strategic shift toward a prevention-led, intelligence-driven regulatory posture. This role is not about being “on the tools” but about building organisational capability slowly and sustainably, by embedding digital analytics and insight-led thinking across the business.

This is your chance to be part of the transformation, not as a bystander, but as a leader.

As the steward of enterprise data and intelligence, you will lead the development of a strategy and architecture model that anticipates future needs, identifies skill gaps, and positions Ahpra to leverage data for proactive regulatory interventions. You will guide the organisation in moving beyond reactive compliance, using predictive modelling, trend analysis, and clustering to uncover issues before they emerge. This includes establishing a baseline for digital maturity, benchmarking against best practice frameworks, and driving innovation in how insights inform decision-making.

Influence national reform and system-wide change, while leading with integrity, visibility, and purpose. 

The CDAIO will also play a critical role in national collaboration by partnering with State, Territory, and Federal Health departments, co-regulators, and external stakeholders to share intelligence that supports health workforce sustainability.

About You

You are a forward-thinking, intelligence-led leader who thrives on shaping strategy and guiding organisations toward future-focused solutions. You understand the difference between IT and digital analytics and can translate complex data concepts into actionable insights for non-technical audiences. You are not just a strategist, you walk alongside teams, building capability and confidence while setting a clear vision for enterprise data and analytics.

You bring curiosity and a strong external orientation, scanning the horizon for signals, frameworks, and innovations that can inform Ahpra’s approach. You are collaborative and influential, able to engage with senior stakeholders across jurisdictions and co-design solutions that address systemic challenges. Above all, you are committed to ethical, transparent, and responsible use of data to build public trust.

This is more than a career move; it’s a chance to shape the next generation of health regulation in Australia. As Chief Data, Analytics, and Insights Officer you will bring:

Strategic Leadership: Proven ability to design and execute enterprise-wide data and analytics strategies that enable proactive, prevention-led regulation.
Digital Analytics Expertise: Experience in leveraging digital insights not just raw data, to inform business decisions, improve user experience, and benchmark organisational performance.
Advanced Analytics Capability: Knowledge of predictive modelling, trend analysis, and clustering techniques to anticipate risk and inform regulatory interventions.
Enterprise Architecture & Capability Building: Ability to identify skill gaps, build multidisciplinary teams, and uplift organisational data literacy.
External Intelligence & Partnerships: Strong track record of collaborating with health departments, co-regulators, and external partners to share insights and shape workforce sustainability.
Governance & Ethics: Deep understanding of data governance, privacy legislation, and ethical frameworks, ensuring compliance and transparency.
Influential Communication: Skilled at translating complex analytics into clear, actionable insights for executives, policymakers, and non-technical stakeholders.
