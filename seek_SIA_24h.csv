Job Description


About the Group/Team

The Editing Platform group sits within the Design Experience supergroup and powers the foundations that enable anyone, anywhere, to create beautiful designs with speed and confidence. We build secure, performant, reliable, and scalable platform capabilities that support Canva’s editor and unlock powerful new product experiences.

Within this group, the Design Import team is focused on making it effortless for users to bring their designs into Canva from external tools and formats. We work at the intersection of rendering systems, file parsing, performance engineering, and user experience — ensuring that imported designs are accurate, editable, and production-ready. Our work plays a critical role in reducing friction for new users and deepening value for teams and enterprises migrating to Canva.

About the Role/Specialty:

As the first Senior Machine Learning Engineer on Design Import, you’ll be pioneering ML capability within the team. You’ll bring conceptual and practical expertise to complex problems and apply machine learning techniques to improve import accuracy, structure recognition, layout reconstruction, and performance optimization.

You’ll work cross-functionally with backend engineers, rendering experts, product managers, and designers to identify high-impact ML opportunities. As the first MLE in the team, you’ll shape strategy, define best practices, and build scalable ML systems that integrate deeply into Canva’s editor platform.

This role is ideal for someone who thrives in ambiguity, enjoys building from first principles, and wants to make foundational impact in a high-scale, product-led environment.

What you’ll do (responsibilities)

Design, build, and deploy machine learning models that improve the accuracy and quality of design imports at scale.

Work closely with engineers to integrate ML systems into high-performance backend and rendering pipelines.

Define data strategies — including data collection, labeling approaches, and evaluation frameworks — to continuously improve model performance.

Take a new perspective on existing import solutions and apply analytical thinking to solve complex, ambiguous problems.

Contribute to architectural decisions that impact the broader Editing Platform ecosystem.

Champion experimentation, monitoring, and model observability best practices.

Collaborate across teams to identify opportunities where ML can unlock step-change improvements in user experience.

What we're looking for:


You’re a strong technical craftsperson who combines deep ML expertise with product intuition. You’re comfortable operating independently and taking ownership of complex problem spaces, while still valuing collaboration and feedback.

We’re looking for someone who:

Has strong experience building and deploying machine learning models in production environments.

Has hands-on experience with Python and ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) and experience shipping scalable systems.

Demonstrates conceptual and practical expertise in areas such as computer vision, document/layout understanding, structured data extraction, or related fields.

Is comfortable navigating ambiguity and shaping problem definitions in a fast-scaling environment.

Thinks beyond model performance — considering system design, latency, reliability, and user impact.

Communicates clearly and can translate complex ML concepts into actionable engineering decisions.

Greenfield opportunity to define a global quantitative capability


Direct influence on product strategy and international expansion


Work with sophisticated institutional clients at scale


A high-growth B2B financial services technology company is appointing a Head of Quantitative in a newly created role to build and lead its next-generation modelling capability.

Operating at the intersection of wealth management, actuarial science and enterprise software, this business partners with tier-one financial institutions across Australia, the UK and Europe to modernise how financial advice is delivered at scale.

This is a rare opportunity to architect stochastic modelling frameworks from first principles, while building and leading a world-class quantitative function with global reach.

The opportunity
The business is at a pivotal inflection point and is poised for continued market traction.

Having successfully deployed deterministic advice models at institutional scale, the next phase of growth requires the introduction of sophisticated stochastic modelling to unlock new markets, new products and materially improved customer outcomes.

As Head of Quantitative, you will:

Define the quantitative strategy


Lead the technical uplift to stochastic modelling


Build and scale a high-performing team


Act as the ultimate authority on model risk, integrity and regulatory alignment
This is a genuine player–coach role, with significant hands-on technical ownership.

What you’ll be responsible for
Architect and deliver stochastic modelling frameworks (Monte Carlo, scenario generation, multi-goal optimisation)


Lead the transition from deterministic Excel-based models to scalable calculation engines


Translate complex regulatory and advice policy requirements into robust quantitative logic


Build, mentor and scale a quantitative team across Australia and global markets


Partner closely with Product and Engineering to productionise models at scale


Engage directly with tier-one institutional clients, actuarial teams and regulators


Own quantitative governance, validation and model risk standards globally
What it will take to make an impact
Deep expertise in stochastic / actuarial / quantitative modelling


Strong hands-on background in tools such as Excel, Python or actuarial modelling platforms


Experience operating in regulated financial services environments (wealth, retirement, insurance or advice technology)


Proven ability to lead technical teams while remaining hands-on


Confidence engaging with C-level stakeholders, institutional clients and regulators


Comfort operating in ambiguity within a high-growth, product-led business


Advanced qualifications in Actuarial Science, Mathematics, Statistics or a related quantitative field are highly regarded.

If you’re motivated by complex problems, real-world impact and global scale, this is a rare leadership opportunity.  Call Michelle Rubinstein at The Onset on 0413 463 043 for a confidential discussion or apply online."
