This role suits either an experienced supply chain applications lead looking for a new challenge, or a senior supply chain systems analyst who is ready to step into broader ownership and leadership.

You may already be the go-to person for complex issues, integrations, and data questions. Or you may be leading applications today and looking for a role with greater influence, clearer transformation intent, and the chance to shape a platform journey rather than simply maintain the status quo.

Either way, this position offers real scope. You’ll take ownership of a core suite of supply chain applications while leading a small, capable and knowledgeable team and partnering closely with operations. At the same time, you’ll play a key role in an ongoing transition away from long-standing in-house systems toward modern, vendor-led platforms.

It’s a role that balances continuity and change, keeping critical systems stable today while helping shape the future supply chain technology landscape.

What you’ll do

Lead and coordinate day-to-day support of core supply chain applications across logistics, inventory, planning, and dispatch
Act as the senior escalation point for critical incidents, remaining hands-on where needed to diagnose and resolve issues
Partner closely with supply chain stakeholders to identify problems, prioritise enhancements, and improve processes
Oversee upgrades, patches, and new functionality, ensuring strong testing, communication, and minimal disruption
Lead, mentor, and support a small, experienced applications team, encouraging knowledge sharing and continuous improvement
Contribute to the supply chain systems roadmap, supporting the transition from legacy platforms to modern, integrated solutions

What you’ll bring

Strong experience supporting or leading supply chain applications within logistics, distribution, or manufacturing environments
Either: a) experience in an applications lead or similar role, or b) senior-level experience as a supply chain systems analyst with readiness to step into leadership
Solid technical foundations including SQL, data analysis, integrations, and complex troubleshooting
Confidence engaging with business stakeholders and influencing priorities and decisions
A pragmatic, hands-on mindset combined with the ability to think beyond day-to-day support
Familiarity with ITIL practices and ITSM tools such as ServiceNow or Jira

Why this role

Broad ownership: responsibility across both operational stability and platform evolution
Visible impact: supply chain systems are mission-critical to the business
Leadership opportunity: lead an experienced team and shape how applications are run
Transformation focus: play an active role in moving from legacy systems to modern supply chain platforms

Own the numbers that shape how a high-growth tech company scales.
 
In a nutshell
This is a senior, hands-on role for a data analyst who cares deeply about accuracy, clarity, and commercial impact. You'll own Removify's core metrics, dashboards, and reporting, creating a trusted source of truth that helps the business understand what's driving performance, where to focus, and what decisions actually matter.
 
We're a data-rich, operations-heavy business with proprietary systems, high volume, and global growth ambitions. This role isn't about producing more dashboards, it's about producing better insight, challenging assumptions, and making data genuinely useful as we scale.
 
If you enjoy translating messy, complex data into clear, actionable insight and aren't afraid to say ""that metric won't help"", this role is for you.
 
Why Removify?
Removify is a fast-growing digital reputation management company operating at scale across Australia, the US, and other global markets. We combine customer-facing products with complex internal operational systems that power how we deliver services at volume.
 
As the business has grown, so has the importance of our data. We sit on a unique mix of commercial, operational, and product data, creating real opportunities to improve performance, efficiency, and decision-making.
 
This is a chance to step into a senior, high-impact analytics role where your work directly influences how the business operates and scales.
 
What you'll be owning
You'll take full ownership of our core analytics layer, from definitions through to insight.
 
Metrics, Definitions & Source of Truth

Own and maintain the data dictionary and KPI definitions
Establish a single source of truth for business-critical metrics
Validate assumptions and ensure data accuracy and consistency
Dashboards & Reporting

Design, maintain, and rationalise dashboards across multiple BI tools
Organise reporting for clarity and usability, reducing noise, not adding to it
Ensure leaders trust the data they're using to make decisions
Insight & Analysis

Proactively analyse data to surface trends, drivers, risks, and opportunities
Translate vague or poorly formed requests into meaningful analysis
Explain why something matters, not just what happened
Commercial & Operational Understanding

Analyse revenue drivers, retention and churn, cost drivers, and operational throughput
Help the business understand efficiency, performance, and scale constraints
Partner with stakeholders to ensure insights are actionable and decision-led
Product & Customer Reporting

Work with Product and Technology teams to inform and improve customer-facing metrics and reports
Ensure external reporting is accurate, meaningful, and aligned with internal definitions
You'll work closely with the CEO and senior leaders and partner with experienced engineers who deeply understand our systems.
 
What we're looking for
You're a senior analyst who has worked in complex, commercial environments and understands the responsibility that comes with owning business-critical data. You're comfortable challenging requests, asking better questions, and prioritising insight over activity.
 
You care about correctness, context, and impact, and you want your work to actually influence decisions.
 
Must-haves

Strong SQL and data interrogation skills
Comfortable querying complex datasets and joining across multiple sources
Proven experience owning data dictionaries and metric definitions
Experience working across multiple BI or data visualisation tools, with deep expertise in at least one
Strong commercial and operational mindset (revenue, retention, costs, efficiency)
Ability to translate vague requests into clear, actionable insight
