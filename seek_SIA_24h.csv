Tertiary qualifications in a relevant discipline, for example finance, accounting, engineering, economics, law, business administration or international relations.
Strong analytical, problem‑solving and communication skills across quantitative and qualitative domains.
Experience working with datasets and building or interpreting economic/financial models.
Ability to translate complex analysis into actionable insights for non‑technical audiences.
Experience advising government on strategic policy issues, or a strong interest in developing this expertise.
Excellent interpersonal and client‑management skills, with confidence engaging internal and external stakeholders.
