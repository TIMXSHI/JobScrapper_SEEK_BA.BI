At Inside Policy, project management is about creating the conditions for good work to happen.

THE ROLE

As Senior Manager – Projects, you will play a key leadership role in overseeing the delivery of multiple projects across the business.

·      Identify delivery risks and pressures early, and work constructively with teams and leadership to adjust approach as needed.

·      Contribute to improving project management tools, templates and ways of working across Inside Policy.

·      Build strong working relationships with clients and partners, supporting clear communication and trust throughout delivery.

This is a leadership role for someone who enjoys making complex projects run well, supporting others to deliver, and strengthening how an organisation delivers work at scale.

SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE

We’re looking for someone who brings:

·       Demonstrated experience leading complex projects end-to-end, with clear accountability for delivery, resourcing, risk and outcomes in fast-moving or ambiguous environments.

·       Demonstrated people leadership experience, including supporting and developing staff across multiple projects.

·       Experience working in consulting, advisory, evaluation or research contexts, with responsibility for managing and delivering projects rather than overseeing programs or policy processes.

·       Sound judgement, strong organisational skills and the ability to manage competing priorities.

·       A collaborative, calm and practical approach to problem-solving and delivery.

·       An interest in improving systems, processes and ways of working to support better project outcomes.

QUALIFICATIONS
A relevant tertiary qualification, or equivalent professional experience, with demonstrated responsibility for leading and delivering complex projects or work programs in advisory, evaluation or consulting contexts.

What you’d be doing in this role

As Canva scales, change is part of our DNA. While your role will evolve over time, here’s a flavour of what you’ll be working on when you start:

Leading Product Analytics Engineering: Own and lead the Analytics Engineering function for the Product Org, with Product AEs reporting to you and the team expected to grow over time.

Driving Analytics Architecture of the Future: Define, own, and evolve Canva’s Product Analytics Engineering architecture, including modular data domains, semantic layers, metrics systems, and AI-ready foundations.

Elevating Analytics Engineering (AE) Craft: Set clear standards and best practices for analytics engineering across Product, and coach AEs across levels to consistently deliver high-quality, scalable data assets.

Partnering Across Product & Data: Work closely with Product Managers, Data Scientists, Engineers, and Platform teams to translate complex product needs into robust, reusable analytics solutions.

Balancing Strategy and Delivery: Combine long-term architectural thinking with pragmatic execution, ensuring AE effort is focused on the highest-impact Product initiatives.

Acting as a Technical Leader: Be the senior escalation point for complex analytics problems and represent Analytics Engineering perspectives in Product and Data leadership forums.

Hands-on Where It Matters Most: Get actively involved in complex or high-leverage analytics engineering work, while setting the technical direction for the team.

You're probably a match if…

You have extensive experience across Analytics Engineering, Data Engineering, or Software Engineering roles.

You’ve led and coached Analytics Engineering teams, including managing senior engineers and growing teams.

You’re deeply experienced with modern data platforms and tooling (e.g. SQL-based warehouses such as Snowflake, dbt-style transformations, orchestration, and semantic layers).

You have strong opinions (weakly held) — backed by experience — on data modelling, analytics architecture, and platform scalability and are eager to try new approaches.

You’re comfortable operating at the intersection of technical depth, people leadership, and strategy.

You thrive on collaboration and can communicate clearly with both highly technical partners and senior non-technical stakeholders.

You care deeply about data quality, reliability, performance, and cost efficiency.

Defining and promoting data modeling standards across the Infra Supergroup to ensure a unified and disciplined approach to data architecture.

Designing and maintaining a robust Infra semantic layer to guarantee a ""single source of truth"" for metrics and dimensions across all BI and analytical tools.

Partnering with cross-functional teams to lead the delivery of complex, high-impact projects from ideation to production.

Championing engineering best practices, with a focus on performance, scalability, reliability, and code quality.

You have a proven track record of building scalable data solutions to solve complex, high-impact business challenges.

You’re fluent in advanced SQL and bring deep, hands-on experience in modern data modelling.

You’re proficient with Snowflake and AWS, and experienced with data transformation and orchestration tools (e.g. dbt, Airflow).

You are comfortable coding in Python.

You lead with an ownership mindset, communicate with clarity and influence, and thrive in collaborative, fast-moving environments.
