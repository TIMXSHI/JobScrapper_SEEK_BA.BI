We need a senior Business Analyst to lead our BA team and become the expert on OmniStar, our grants, ethics and research management platform for government agencies and universities.

You'll manage a team of analysts, work directly with enterprise clients on complex requirements, and handle the analysis work that needs senior experience. This is a hands-on role - you'll be deep in the product, setting standards for the team, and working closely with developers to design and document features.




The Job

You'll develop deep expertise in OmniStar and lead a team of 6-8 business analysts. You'll work directly with government agencies and universities to design and document features for complex web applications. You'll set quality standards, mentor team members, and work closely with our development team to translate business needs into technical solutions.

This means running workshops with senior stakeholders, eliciting requirements for complicated compliance workflows, creating detailed specifications, and making sure nothing falls through the cracks. You'll review team deliverables, handle difficult client conversations, and guide decisions on projects.

The platform handles research grants, ethics approvals, and compliance tracking for government agencies and universities. Our clients need detailed requirements documentation, careful process design, and solutions that meet strict compliance standards. Experience with government, healthcare, research, or finance environments will be directly applicable.




What We Need

10+ years doing Business Analysis or Systems Analysis in software development

You've led, managed, or mentored analysts before

Technical understanding - you can talk to developers about databases, APIs, and system architecture

Government or complex stakeholder experience - public sector, universities, or heavily regulated industries

Expert at documentation - your specs are clear and comprehensive

Workshop facilitation skills - you can run a room and extract requirements from difficult stakeholders

Process modelling experience (UML, BPMN, etc.)

Worked in Agile environments

Australian citizenship (required for security clearance eligibility)

What we'd love to see:

Existing Australian government security clearance (we can sponsor if you don't have one)

Experience with grants, research administration, ethics, or compliance systems

SQL or database skills

Background in SaaS platforms with multiple client implementations

What actually matters most: You have sound judgement. You work independently. You understand things the first time. You know when to push back and when to compromise. Developers respect your input because you understand constraints. Nothing slips through the cracks on your watch.




About F1 Solutions

We're a 30-year-old Australian software company in Canberra. We build OmniStar for government and university clients across Australia and internationally.

Meaningful work, technical depth, and autonomy. We're stable (30+ years, ongoing government contracts), we support professional development (IIBA, Agile certifications), and we're realistic about work-life balance.

We don't have ping pong tables or unlimited snacks. We do have interesting technical problems, sophisticated clients, and the opportunity to shape solutions rather than just execute someone else's plan.

This role is onsite in Canberra.
