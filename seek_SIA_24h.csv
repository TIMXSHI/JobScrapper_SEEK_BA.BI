Are you ready to lead the transformation of customer insights and analytics in a dynamic, growth-focused environment? We’re seeking a visionary Head of Customer Insights, Data & Analytics to drive our enterprise-wide strategy, harnessing advanced analytics and human-centred design to deliver actionable insights that shape our future. 

About the role

Imagine a business where every decision is powered by genuine customer understanding. That’s what we’re building, and we need you to lead the way. 

We’re on the hunt for a Head of Customer Insights, Data & Analytics who’s ready to shake things up. You won’t just run surveys or crunch data - you’ll transform how we listen, learn, and act. You’ll turn scattered information into integrated, multi-source insights that actually predict what’s next, not just explain what happened. 

You’ll be the architect of our insights strategy, moving us from “what did our customers do?” to “what will they do next - and why?” You’ll lead research programmes that dig deep into customer journeys, brand perceptions, and those under-explored segments that everyone else overlooks. Residential VHB, multi-residential builders, plumbers, commercial developers - you’ll know what makes them tick, and you’ll help us serve them better. 

But it’s not just about the data. You’ll champion digital engagement, building vibrant customer communities and listening in on social channels to catch the whispers before they become trends. You’ll collaborate with universities and research bodies, bringing fresh thinking and credibility to everything we do. 

Your insights will shape our marketing, sales, and innovation teams’ priorities. You’ll be the storyteller who turns complex analytics into clear, actionable recommendations for our Executive and Senior Leadership Team. When you speak, people will listen - and act. 

You’ll deliver:

A customer insights strategy that’s woven into our corporate and marketing plans.
Integrated reports that combine internal and external data, giving us the full picture.
Segment-specific insights that unlock growth in every corner of our business.
Brand equity tracking and service blueprints that reveal what our customers really experience.
Digital dashboards and predictive models that drive acquisition, retention, and lifetime value. 

You’ll bring:

A proven track record leading customer data, analytics, and insights in a fast-paced B2B/B2C environment.
Experience in leveraging data from CS platforms such as Genisys 
The ability to turn insights into compelling stories that influence executives and boards.
Deep expertise in qualitative and quantitative research, advanced analytics, and marketing performance.
A discovery mindset and genuine customer empathy.
Hands-on experience with analytics platforms (SQL, Python/R, Tableau/PowerBI).
A knack for digital engagement - customer panels, social listening, online collaboration.
A strong grasp of data governance and privacy compliance.
Experience building external partnerships to extend our insights capability. 

Success here means transforming our insights function from episodic and descriptive to integrated, predictive, and prescriptive. You’ll help us grow, innovate, and put the customer at the heart of every decision.

Forget what you know about typical analyst roles. This isn't about building decks that disappear into committees or running models that never see daylight. This is about sitting at the table where decisions get made, capital gets deployed, and businesses get built.

The Castle Steering Group is the agile innovation engine behind a dynamic multi-entity portfolio spanning hospitality, property, technology, and energy. Its the team that identifies what's next, pressure-tests what matters, and drives momentum across existing businesses while hunting for the opportunities that will define our future.

We're looking for an exceptional Research Analyst—a high-achiever with 5-7 years of battle-tested experience who's ready to move from advising on deals to being inside them. If you've been waiting for a role where your analysis directly influences investment decisions and your recommendations shape strategy, this is it.

What You'll Actually Do

Investment Research & Deal Flow - You'll actively research and evaluate new investment opportunities across sectors, conducting rigorous market analysis, competitive positioning, and commercial due diligence. You'll build the business cases that inform go/no-go decisions on new ventures and acquisitions

Strategic Due Diligence - Execute detailed investigations into potential investments—financial modeling, cross-comparisons against market leaders, risk assessment, and operational feasibility. Your work will directly inform capital allocation decisions, not sit in a filing cabinet.

Portfolio Momentum Management - Keep existing businesses focused and moving forward. You'll identify operational bottlenecks, research efficiency improvements, analyze performance metrics, and recommend actions that unlock growth across the portfolio.

Board-Ready Analysis - Prepare investment memoranda, business cases, and strategic briefing materials for the Group CEO and Castle Steering Group. Your analysis needs to be sharp, defensible, and decision-ready—no fluff, just insight.

Cross-Functional Intelligence - Work alongside the Strategic Advisor on high-level strategy, collaborate with the Investment Manager on deal structuring, and coordinate with the CEO's EA to ensure seamless execution of research deliverables and presentations.

Market Intelligence & Trends - Maintain ongoing sector surveillance across hospitality, property, technology, and energy. Identify emerging opportunities, competitive threats, and market shifts before they become obvious. Be the person who sees what's coming.

Who We're Looking For

5-7 years in investment banking, management consulting, or corporate strategy
Direct experience in deal analysis, due diligence, or investment evaluation
Demonstrated ability to build robust financial models and business cases
Track record of influencing senior stakeholders with analytical insights
Excellent written and verbal communication—you can distill complexity into clarity

The Differentiators

High-Achiever Mentality

You're the person who consistently exceeds expectations and raises the bar
Track record of being the ""go-to"" analyst on your team
Intellectually curious—you dig deeper than required because you genuinely want to understand
Comfortable with ambiguity and able to structure unstructured problems

Agile Operator

You thrive in fast-moving environments where priorities shift and speed matters
Comfortable working across multiple projects simultaneously without losing quality
Don't need hand-holding—you identify what needs to be done and do it
Resilient under pressure and energized by intensity rather than overwhelmed by it

Commercial Instinct

You understand that analysis exists to drive decisions, not to be academically interesting
Can balance thoroughness with pragmatism—knowing when 80% certainty is enough to move
Sharp commercial awareness across multiple sectors
Think like an investor, not just an analyst

Team Player with Presence

Confident presenting to and engaging with the Group CEO and senior leadership
Collaborative approach when working with Strategic Advisor, Investment Manager, and EA
Professional demeanor with discretion around sensitive commercial information
Humble enough to learn, confident enough to challenge assumptions constructively

What Success Looks Like

You'll know you're succeeding when:

Your investment recommendations are consistently adopted and inform capital decisions
The CEO relies on your analysis to pressure-test opportunities and strategies
Existing businesses accelerate because you've identified the bottlenecks and solutions
The Steering Group views you as a trusted member of the inner circle, not just support staff
You've built a reputation for delivering sharp, actionable insights under tight timelines
You're involved in conversations about strategy, not just asked to run the numbers
