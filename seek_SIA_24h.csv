About the Business
A proudly Australian success story, my client is a private-equity backed organisation renowned for its manufacturing, innovation, and commitment to quality. The business is entering an exciting new phase of growth, underpinned by a significant capital investment — the development of a new, state-of-the-art manufacturing facility.

As part of this transformation, my client is seeking to appoint a commercially astute finance business partner to play a pivotal role in supporting the financial management of this major initiative.

Key Duties & Responsibilities
Working closely with the various key stakeholders including the CFO and broader leadership team, your responsibilities will include:

Partnering with senior stakeholders to translate complex financial data into clear insights and recommendations.
Developing and presenting business cases and scenario modelling to support high-impact decision making (often requiring quick turnaround, operating 'in the grey' from partial data)
Monitoring and managing project expenditure against approved budgets, forecasts, and cash flow.
Ensuring the accuracy, control and integrity of project financials, invoices and supplier contracts.
Preparing executive-level financial reports and PowerPoint presentations for the SteerCo and Board.
Providing the right financial information to the right people — tailoring insight to the audience for maximum impact.
Supporting project governance and compliance with strong financial discipline and attention to detail.

You will bring:

CA/CPA (or equivalent) qualification with minimum 5 years' experience in a comparable finance role.
Proven exposure to large-scale capital or transformation projects.
Strong financial modelling and scenario analysis capability, with the ability to work with incomplete or evolving data at pace
Excellent communication and presentation skills — confident preparing Board-ready packs and engaging with non-financial stakeholders.
Tech-savvy mindset with a focus on efficiency and automation rather than manual processes (including PowerBI)
A collaborative, pragmatic approach with strong commercial acumen and attention to detail.
What’s in it for You

This is a rare opportunity to join a highly respected Australian brand at a defining moment in its growth story. You’ll play a central role in a hugely significant investment, helping shape the future of its operations and long-term success.

You’ll work alongside an exceptional leadership team in a culture that values creativity, collaboration and authenticity. This is a role where your insight will genuinely influence outcomes, and where you’ll see your work make a tangible impact.
