The Opportunity 

Stowe Australia is embarking on a major national transformation of our Health, Safety, Environment, and Quality (HSEQ) systems. We are moving away from legacy processes to implement the HSI Donesafe platform across our entire national operation.  To support this program, we’re seeking an experienced Data Analysis & Testing Lead. 

This is a core assurance and is essential to the successful delivery of the program.  This role will own the data quality, extraction, cleansing, validation and end to end UAT making this role a key determinant of whether the platform is safe, accurate, and ready for national deployment.   

This is a hands-on, high-impact contract role where you will work directly with the project team, SMEs, and the vendor to ensure the platform is ready for a successful national rollout. 

The Role 

As the Data & Testing Lead, you will be responsible for: 

Leading data mapping, cleansing, transformation, migration and validation activities 
Developing and implementing end-to-end testing strategies, comprehensive test plans, detailed scripts, and UAT governance  
Coordinating and executing UAT across 25+ Donesafe modules 
Managing defects, retesting and go-live readiness 
Working closely with the HSI Donesafe vendor team and Stowe SMEs 
Supporting documentation, reporting and change readiness activities 
You will be the key technical and Quality Assurance specialist for this transformation program.

Essential 

5+ years in data analysis, data migration or data governance 
Strong experience leading UAT and functional testing for SaaS/enterprise systems 
Ability to create clear test plans, test cases, scripts and traceability 
Excellent Excel capability (Power Query, XLOOKUP, cleansing, validation) 
Strong communication and stakeholder engagement skills 
Ability to work independently and proactively in a fast-paced delivery environment 

Nice to Have 

Experience with HSI Donesafe, HSI Solv, or other HSE/WHS systems (INX, Bsafe etc) 
Background in construction, electrical, mining, field services or compliance industries 
Experience with integrations (API/SFTP), SQL or Power BI 

Why Join This Project? 

Impact: Play a key role in a high profile digital transformation for an industry leader and deliver a platform that will enhance safety and operational excellence across the business 
Influence: You aren’t just inheriting a system; you are helping design it from the ground up to ensure it works for our people.  
Longevity: While this is a 6-month contract, extension is highly likely as we move into national rollout and continuous improvement phases.
