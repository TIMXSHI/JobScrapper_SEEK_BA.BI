We look to partner with shareholders and management to assist in growing their company.  We provide capital for growth and to facilitate existing shareholders to “take some chips off the table”, and partner to jointly develop and execute on a business growth plan; we are particularly active in working with portfolio companies post investment.  We are fortunate to have long-term patient capital, we adopt a long-term investment approach, and we are flexible with regard to our ownership requirements. 

Role Summary:

We are seeking a Commercial Data Solutions Analyst to drive measurable value creation across a portfolio of businesses.

This is not a traditional BI or reporting role. The mandate is to identify commercial leverage, translate insight into financial impact, and support execution that improves revenue, margin, and EBITDA outcomes.

The role combines strong commercial finance acumen with a problem-to-solution mindset, using AI-enabled analytics tools to accelerate insight generation at scale. Technology is an enabler; commercial judgement and value creation are the priority.

Key Responsibilities:

·       Identify and quantify commercial value creation opportunities across portfolio companies, including margin improvement, revenue optimisation, and leakage identification.

·       Analyse unit economics, gross margin drivers, pricing dynamics, and cost structures to uncover actionable performance levers.

·       Develop clear business cases and ROI models that link analysis directly to EBITDA impact.

·       Proactively identify and deploy AI-enabled analytics tools (e.g. Claude, Claude Code, ChatGPT) to accelerate data interrogation, scenario modelling, and insight generation.

·       Stay current with advances in AI tooling and continuously refine how these tools are applied to improve speed, quality, and repeatability of analysis.

·       Translate insight into execution by working closely with operating partners and leadership teams.

·       Frame ambiguous operational challenges into structured, hypothesis-led analytical approaches.

Build repeatable analytical frameworks that can be deployed across multiple portfolio companies.

Qualifications & Experience:

·       3–6 years’ experience in commercial finance, strategy, consulting, or analytically intensive commercial roles.

·       Strong commercial finance acumen, including deep understanding of gross margin mechanics, unit economics, pricing strategy, and cost drivers.

·       Demonstrated ability to translate analysis into financial impact through business case development, scenario modelling, and ROI analysis.

·       Strong interest in AI, data and emerging analytics tools (e.g., Claude, Claude Code, Chat GPT, SQL, Excel, Power BI/Tableau, Python/R preferred), or similar platforms to enhance productivity and insight generation.

·       Strong stakeholder influence skills, with experience working alongside senior leaders to convert insight into action.

·       High intellectual curiosity, comfort with ambiguity, and a bias toward solving problems rather than reporting on them.

·       Bachelor’s degree in Business, Commerce, Economics, Engineering, Mathematics, or a related discipline.

90450544,Commercial Strategy and Analytics Lead,Animal Emergency Australia,https://www.seek.com.au/job/90450544?type=standard&ref=search-standalone&origin=jobCard#sol=53619767ace2e51aebe5e9aea91c0fb3b9bfa71a,8h ago,8.0,2026-02-19T23:00:00+00:00,"Springwood, Brisbane QLD (Hybrid)",Analysis & Reporting (Accounting),Full time,,"About Us
Animal Emergency Australia (AEA) is a network of 24/7 emergency veterinary hospitals, general practices, and support services across the country. We’re here to help veterinary professionals do and be their best — delivering high-quality care, education, and innovation. At AEA, we believe that behind every great vet team is a great support team — and that’s where you come in.

About the Role
The Commercial Strategy and Analytics Lead shapes and governs the commercial intelligence that underpins AEA’s most important strategic and operational decisions. The role exists to define what “good” looks like economically, guide sustainable growth and capital allocation, and translate pricing, workforce, and investment decisions into clear commercial outcomes. It blends strategic problem-solving, financial modelling, and advanced analytics to cut through noise and establish a defensible, data-led view of performance across the network.

Acting as the single source of commercial truth, this role owns enterprise commercial models, assumptions, and Business Intelligence strategy. It enables evidence-based decision-making by Executives and the Board and has the authority to challenge decisions not supported by data. While final decisions sit with leadership, this role is accountable for the quality, integrity, and coherence of the insights that inform them—allowing leaders to focus on deciding, not debating the data.

This is a full-time hybrid role based out of our Animal Emergency Australia Springwood office.

Key Responsibilities

Own long-term growth, capacity and investment models to guide network expansion, capital allocation and Board-level decisions.
Lead data-driven pricing and margin analysis, translating complex commercial trade-offs into clear, evidence-based decisions.
Develop workforce and remuneration models to support scalable growth, productivity improvements and informed people planning.
Provide rigorous commercial and financial modelling for major strategic initiatives, acting as a trusted internal advisory resource.
Own the BI strategy and tools, ensuring consistent metrics, strong governance, and executive-ready insights across the organisation.
Turn complex analysis into clear, actionable insights that strengthen executive decision-making and analytical maturity.

About You

Ex-consulting, commercial or pricing strategy background with strong commercial problem-solving discipline.
5–8+ years in strategy, commercial analytics, FP&A, or enterprise analytics roles.
Advanced financial modelling capability (long-range, scenario, sensitivity).
Strong BI and analytics fluency (Power BI essential; Anaplan highly desirable).
Comfortable operating across ambiguity, senior stakeholders, and competing priorities.
Credibility to challenge executives with evidence, not opinion.
Interested in an enterprise decision-enablement role (this is not a reporting role)

Competitive salary approximately $160, 000 + Super + 17.5% annual leave loading
Hybrid work options available (initial training in Springwood office)
Join Australia’s largest employee-owned veterinary group
