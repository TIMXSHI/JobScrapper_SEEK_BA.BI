Exceptional SQL skills (must-have), including advanced analytical functions.
Strong experience in data modelling and creating data marts.
Ability to analyse and interpret data effectively.
Exposure to cloud platforms (AWS ideal, others welcome).
Excellent communication skills to engage with business and technical teams.
Self-starter with strong initiative and investigative mindset.
Ability to wear multiple hats and adapt to changing priorities.

In this role, you'll be expected to quickly understand the existing solution and identify which hubs do what, then build on top of current designs while ensuring scalability and usability. Success will require strong problem-solving and analytical thinking—knowing where to start, what to do, and who to involve at each stage. If this sounds like you, we'd love to see your application come through!
