About us
We're on a mission to create a brighter future, where you can be a change maker at the actual source. We're one of Australia's largest water utilities with over 30% of Victoria's population relying on us for their essential water and sanitation services.

Our award-winning culture fosters an inclusive, collaborative, and flexible environment that enables our people to thrive. Here, you'll be inspired and challenged to grow alongside us.

We're committed to reconciliation and supporting the self-determined role for Traditional Owners/Custodians in water and land management.

The Role
As the Asset Data and Information Governance Lead, you'll be at the forefront of ensuring our asset data is a reliable and valuable resource. This isn't just about managing data; it's about leading the charge to create, implement, and continuously improve standards that support every stage of an asset's life cycle. You'll operate with a high degree of autonomy, serving as a vital link between business stakeholders and technical teams. Your mission is to translate business needs into practical data and information governance initiatives, championing a culture of data-informed decision-making and helping align our systems (like AMS and GIS) with our strategic asset management goals.

Your key responsibilities

Define, implement, and maintain asset data governance standards, ensuring the data is accurate, consistent, and aligned with the organisation's overall data framework. This includes developing procedures, data audits, and quality assurance protocols to ensure data integrity and reliability.
Identify and prioritise initiatives to improve asset data quality, integration, and interoperability. You will work closely with data analytics and asset transformation teams to develop automated data pipelines that align with governance policies and support strategic decision-making.
Define and maintain governance standards for all asset information products. This involves aligning asset management systems (e.g., Maximo) and GIS with strategic objectives, regulatory requirements, and improvement initiatives to ensure that our tools meet stakeholder needs.
Take ownership of our asset and functional system classification hierarchy. You will oversee its implementation within our core systems, including the cleanup of legacy data to ensure it meets current standards and naming conventions.
Build, maintain, and optimise data models in asset intelligence systems. Your work will enable accurate and timely reporting and insights, and you'll provide expert guidance to business users on data model optimisation and visualisation best practices. You will also monitor and manage the performance of these models, troubleshooting issues and proactively identifying improvements.
Serve as the primary liaison between Asset Services and other key teams like Asset Technology & Transformation and Enterprise Data Analytics. You will facilitate collaboration, capture business requirements, and translate them into clear, actionable technical initiatives.
Work to build the capability of reporting officers and other business users. You will document report structures, processes, and metadata to ensure sustainable reporting practices and data usability across the business.

What we're looking for

Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Information Systems, Data Analytics, Engineering, or a related field.
Relevant certifications in Power BI, Azure Data Engineering, or data governance.
Knowledge of asset management standards and lifecycle planning frameworks (e.g. ISO 55000, risk-based decision-making).
Demonstrated experience in asset information management or asset data governance, including the development and maintenance of classification hierarchies.
Experience implementing and improving asset data governance frameworks, data quality standards, and compliance processes.
Advanced skills in designing and optimising semantic models in Power BI, including advanced DAX, Power Query, and data modelling best practices.
Proficiency in SQL and working knowledge of Azure-based data platforms (e.g. Azure SQL DB, Data Factory) for developing and maintaining data pipelines.
Strong interpersonal and communication skills, with demonstrated ability to translate complex business needs into technical requirements and liaise across operational, IT, and strategic teams.
Ability to lead initiatives independently, identify data or governance issues, and drive cross-functional improvements.

About the opportunity    

Welcome to our world where things move fast, priorities shift quickly, and data is the engine powering it all. 

We’re a high-energy, fast-paced team operating in what we like to call organised chaos, where clear processes meet constant change, and no two days look the same. If you’re someone who thrives in a dynamic, agile environment, enjoys solving complex problems on the fly, and can balance structure with speed, this is the role for you. 

You’re a high-output problem solver who doesn’t get rattled by shifting priorities. You know how to move fast and think deeply. You bring structure to chaos, and calm to complexity without ever losing sight of outcomes. 

 

What makes our team different? 

We don’t just analyse data; we solve real-world problems. Our team is always looking for smarter, faster, and more efficient ways to work, whether that means automating manual processes, streamlining workflows, or finding creative solutions to everyday challenges. If you love improving how things get done and thrive on making a tangible impact, you’ll fit right in. 

 

What you’ll deliver with us 

Build and maintain scalable data solutions using tools like BigQuery, Airflow, and Git, ensuring clean, trusted, and analytics-ready datasets.
Enhance data quality and governance through automated testing, documentation, and best practice data modelling.
Deliver actionable insights via advanced analysis and problem-solving techniques (including RCA and DMAIC) to inform commercial and operational strategy.
Collaborate across teams to support reporting, dashboard development, and a data-driven culture aligned with safety, customer focus, and innovation.
Thrive in an environment where priorities shift quickly and no two days look the same adaptability and resilience are key to success in this role.
Champion continuous improvement, always seeking innovative ways to enhance data processes, tools, and solutions.
Tackle manual problems head-on, finding better ways to do things and driving continuous improvement. You’ll have the freedom to challenge the status quo, automate processes, and help shape how our business operates.

 

About you 

You’re a detail-oriented and collaborative data professional with a passion for turning complex datasets into clear, actionable insights. You bring strong technical capability, a sharp analytical mindset, and a practical understanding of logistics or supply chain operations. You’re confident working independently or in a cross-functional team and thrive in a fast-paced, outcomes-focused environment. 

You’ll bring: 

Over 2 year of experience in data analysis, ideally within logistics, supply chain, or network operations..
Over 1 year of hands-on experience with technical proficiency in GCP (BigQuery, Cloud Run, BigQuery ML), Python, SQL, Composer (Airflow), Tableau, Excel, Git, Jira, and Confluence. Experience with Vertex AI is a plus.
Strong communication and problem-solving skills, with the ability to translate data into clear business insights and influence decision-making.
A collaborative mindset, capable of working across teams, managing stakeholder needs, and supporting continuous improvement in a complex enterprise environment.
The ability to bring structure to ambiguity, and a positive, solutions-focused mindset to every challenge.
A passion for improving manual processes and finding better ways to work.

Join one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse workforces in Australia.
We deliver on our values of Trust, Inclusivity, Empowerment, and Safety every day.
Immerse yourself in the AP Way—where every team member learns the vital role we play in delivering on our strategy and purpose.
