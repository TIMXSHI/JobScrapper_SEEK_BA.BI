Let’s create a more sociable future together

At Endeavour, we’re totally into what we do. With a portfolio that includes Dan Murphy’s, BWS, ALH Hotels, Pinnacle Drinks and more, we love to bring people together. Together we share our passion for our products and industry; it’s what inspires us to dream big, and continue to create new experiences for our customers and teams across Australia. If you thrive on positive energy, we want to meet you!

Job Description
Love what you do and leave your mark

Are you a capital management specialist who excels at transforming complex data into strategic clarity?

At Endeavour Group, we are seeking a Senior Finance Analyst to join our Capital & Corporate Advisory team. Reporting to the Senior Finance Manager, you will manage the accounting, forecasting, and governance of our Group Capital. This is a high-visibility role where you will collaborate with finance teams across the entire organization to optimize investment returns and maintain a robust governance framework.

Sound good? Read on.

Here is a taster of what you can expect in this role:

You will lead the annual capital forecast process, providing the business with the clarity needed to make informed investment decisions. From managing the fixed asset lifecycle to providing independent advice on multi-million dollar business cases, your work will directly impact Endeavour’s financial health and strategic direction.

Key Responsibilities

Capital Planning & Governance

Build annual forecasts by partnering with business units to test assumptions and align projections with broader group expectations.
Provide independent review and recommendations on significant capital projects, business cases, and post-implementation reviews.
Ensure adherence to capitalisation policies, investment frameworks, and delegations. You’ll also support the implementation of process enhancements to keep us agile.
Produce annual depreciation budgets and forecasts for selected business units.

Performance, Fixed Assets & Insights

Manage robust month-end closing processes across SAP and non-SAP systems for all fixed asset activities.
Deliver end-to-end governance of the fixed asset register (FAR), including asset creation, transfers, acquisitions, and disposals.
Produce monthly reporting and commentary for senior management, highlighting key drivers and variances to budget.
Establish KPI tracking and a post-implementation review framework to identify opportunities to recycle or reprioritise capital.
Qualifications

Now let’s talk about you: 

You are a commercially-minded finance professional who enjoys the ""detective work"" of analysis as much as the ""diplomacy"" of business partnering. You can navigate a matrix organization with ease and aren't afraid to challenge the status quo to ensure financial discipline.

Your Credentials:

Degree in a financial discipline with CA/CPA (or equivalent) qualification.
5+ years of financial management experience, ideally within a large corporate or matrix environment.
Advanced modelling and analytical skills, with a deep understanding of fixed asset lifecycles and capitalisation policies.
Exceptional written and verbal skills with the ability to translate complex financial drivers into clear business outcomes.
Strong time management skills and the ability to deal effectively with conflict and competing priorities.

The benefits are good too! 

We offer flexible working in every sense
An exclusive discount card for BWS, Dan Murphy’s, Woolworths, BIG W and other Endeavour Group brands, including our ALH pubs
Monthly meeting-free days 
Your health and wellbeing is your most important asset, and as one of our valued team members, it’s our first priority. You will have a range of free services to help you live well and support your physical, mental and financial wellbeing
Endeavour Group is full of opportunities - use our dedicated learning and development options to grow an idea, yourself, and your career. This is just the start, so dream big.

With Kennards Hire You Can
At Kennards Hire, we're a family-owned business building a modern, high-performing data and analytics environment to support strategic and commercial decision-making across the organisation. As part of this growth, we're looking for a Senior BI Developer who can work across the data modelling and reporting layers of our environment with significant experience with Power BI reporting.

If you love shaping clean, trusted data and turning it into insights people can use then this role is for you.

About the Role
This is not a ""just build dashboards"" job. You'll work across the middle and downstream layers of our data ecosystem, contributing to data models in our SQL data warehouse (MDW/MDM), building transformations in DBT, and designing high-quality Power BI datasets, reports and dashboards.

You will play a key role in ensuring our business has accurate, governed, and scalable data that supports everything from financial reporting to operational insights.

What You'll Be Doing

Data Warehouse & Modelling

Develop and maintain SQL data models across the warehouse (landing, staging, curated layers).
Build, enhance, and troubleshoot DBT models powering enterprise reporting.
Partner with data engineers to understand and improve ingestion pipelines (ADF, Fivetran, Logic Apps).
Contribute to data quality, data governance, and MDM-related improvements.
Analytics & BI Development

Develop and maintain Power BI datasets, data models, dashboards and paginated reports.
Optimise performance across semantic models, SQL queries, and report-level DAX.
Ensure accuracy, consistency, and integrity of data consumed by stakeholders.
Support testing, release processes, and best practices across the reporting stack.
Collaboration & Continuous Improvement

Work with business analysts, product owners, finance teams, and operational stakeholders to translate requirements into reliable data solutions.
Troubleshoot issues across the data pipeline-from ingestion to reporting.
Share knowledge, improve processes, and contribute to a modern, scalable BI environment.

About You
You're someone who thrives in the space between data engineering and BI:

A degree in IT or related field of study essential.
5+ years' experience in Power BI development (reports, data models, DAX) is essential.
Strong SQL skills are essential, along with a proven track record in utilising SQL in a warehouse environment.
Hands-on exposure to DBT or similar modelling frameworks.
Understanding of ETL/ELT concepts and data pipelines (Azure Data Factory, Fivetran, Logic Apps).
Solid knowledge of data modelling principles (star schema, dimensions/facts, semantic models).
Strong communication skills and the ability to work closely with both technical and non-technical teams.
Experience with Azure, Python, or DevOps pipelines is a bonus, not a dealbreaker.

You’ll work at the intersection of property, finance and procurement, helping the business understand where money is going, why it’s moving, and what actions make sense.

· Translate complex information into practical insights for senior stakeholders

About you

· Strong problem-solver from a commercial property environment

· Experience using analytics and reporting tools to enable decisions, not just produce reports

· Confident communicator who can explain the why, not just the numbers

Experience & qualifications

· Typically 6–10+ years in a commercial, portfolio or property analyst role

· Degree in Finance, Accounting, Business, Property, or similar (or equivalent experience)

ROLLER isn’t your average SaaS company. We operate globally across 30+ countries, powering millions of real-world experiences in the leisure and attractions industry. What we build doesn’t just live on a screen. It shows up in busy venues, peak weekends, and unforgettable moments for guests.

Our mission is simple but ambitious: help operators run better businesses while creating great guest experiences. That means solving complex, real-world problems across ticketing, point of sale, self-service, memberships, kiosks, and digital waivers, all at meaningful scale.

Just as importantly, it’s the people. We’re a team of 300+ smart, grounded, and genuinely passionate humans working across the globe. We care about quality, ownership, and doing work we’re proud of, without taking ourselves too seriously.

We’re growing fast, aiming high, and building something that matters. If you want to work on real problems, with real customers, alongside people who care deeply about their craft and impact, ROLLER is a great place to do it.




About the Role

We’re looking for a curious, commercially minded Data Analyst to join our Venue Operations Tribe. This role partners closely with Product Managers and tribe leadership to help us understand how venues use ROLLER day-to-day, which features create real value for different venue “archetypes”, and how we can drive smarter product and adoption decisions with evidence and not guesswork.

You’ll work across product usage, feature availability/adoption, and venue performance insights, connecting patterns in the data to decisions that improve outcomes for customers and the business.

This role is based in Melbourne with a hybrid working model from our South Melbourne office.




Why You'll Enjoy This Role

🚀 Real Scale, Real Momentum - If you want your judgment to matter, this is the place. ROLLER is a global, rapidly scaling SaaS business backed by Insight Partners. In 2025, we powered 90 million guest experiences across those 35 countries and we’re growing fast towards 1 billion experiences a year.

📈 Your Work Will Change Real Decisions - Your analysis will directly influence roadmap bets, feature investments, and adoption strategy. This isn’t reporting for reporting’s sake - your work will shape what we build and why.

🤝 Work Side-by-Side With Product Leaders - You’ll partner closely with PMs and tribe leadership - helping frame sharper questions, challenge assumptions, and turn data into direction. You won’t be operating at arm’s length.

🔎 Solve Real Product Analytics Problems - From event streams and audit logs to feature journeys and venue archetypes, you’ll dig into behavioural data to understand how customers actually use ROLLER - not just whether a KPI moved.




Why You Want To Work With Us!

❤️ Loved by Customers - ROLLER is consistently highly rated on Capterra and G2, and trusted by leading operators worldwide. That doesn’t happen by accident. Customer obsession isn’t a value on a wall here, it’s embedded in how we prioritise, build, and measure success.

🏆 A Great Place People Choose to Stay - We’ve been Great Place to Work certified across multiple regions for several years running. That reflects a culture that values trust, autonomy, and growth, and an environment where high standards and psychological safety coexist.

💸 Competitive Package & Real Career Growth - We offer competitive compensation and benefits aligned to the level of ownership we expect. As ROLLER scales, so do the opportunities. People grow here by taking on bigger problems, broader scope, and greater responsibility. Progression is driven by impact and capability, not tenure, and strong performance is recognised and rewarded.




What You'll Do

Drive product and adoption insights: Analyse feature availability, activation and usage to understand what’s working, for who, and why.

Build venue archetypes & playbooks: Identify venue “shapes” (segments/archetypes) that get value from different features and help build data-backed playbooks to nudge the right venues to the right capabilities.

Deep-dive event, audit and activity logs: Go beyond simple “feature on/off” signals, use event streams and audit logs to understand behaviours, journeys, and usage patterns.

Support performance-oriented analysis: Help uncover what “great” looks like, identifying high-performing venues and the behaviours that correlate with exceptional operational outcomes, then surface insights we can share broadly.

Create dashboards & reporting in our BI environment: Build clear, trusted reporting and dashboards (primarily in Looker) that help PMs move quickly and confidently.

Turn analysis into decisions: Provide recommendations to influence product decisions, balancing speed vs accuracy based on the decision context and clearly communicating assumptions/limitations.

Partner cross-functionally: Collaborate with PMs, tribe leadership, and occasionally data/engineering counterparts to improve data quality, expand what’s available in Looker, and define better questions upstream.




About You

Experience using at least one modern BI tool (Looker, Tableau, or Power BI) and can ramp into a new tool quickly.

Strong analytical skills and the ability to work with imperfect/real-world data, knowing when something is “good enough” vs when accuracy is critical.

Product analytics experience (feature adoption, funnels/journeys, engagement/retention patterns).

Confidence querying and wrangling data (e.g. from transactional databases or event datasets), not just working with perfectly-modelled BI layers.

A track record of influencing decisions (ideally in product or SaaS environments), you’ve helped teams change direction, validate bets, or stop a bad idea based on evidence.

Curiosity and product-thinking - you don’t just answer what’s asked, you explore what else the data is saying and proactively surface it.

Strong communication skills with the ability to translate messy analysis into clear insights for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.




Perks!

You get to work on a category-leading product that customers love in a fun, high-growth industry - check our Capterra and G2 reviews.

4 ROLLER Recharge days per year (that is 4 additional days of leave that we all take off together as a team to rest and recuperate) 

Engage in our ‘Vibe Tribe’ - led by our team members; you can contribute to company-wide initiatives directly. Regular events and social activities, fundraising & cause-related campaigns... you name it. We're willing to make it happen!

Team member Assistance Program to proactively support our team's health and wellbeing - access to coaching, education modules, weekly webinars, and more.

16 weeks paid Parental Leave for primary carers and 4 weeks paid Parental Leave for secondary carers

Work with a driven, fun, and switched-on team that likes to raise the bar in all we do.
