Salary Package: $175k-$185k + Super & Bonus

Role highlights: FMCG leader with iconic brands



Role Overview



Exclusive to Reo Group and reporting to the Finance Director, the FP&A Manager is a pivotal role within the commercial finance function, supporting all pillars of the ANZ business as it navigates an exciting period of transformation and growth.

To support ambitious and exciting growth plans, the FP&A Manager will lead the building and implementation of best-in-class processes for a large business. This role will play a pivotal part in shaping how the business operates, helping to design and implement systems that drive insight and performance.

You will lead FP&A processes, support S&OP in collaboration with the commercial teams, and work closely with the SLT to forecast performance, identify risks and opportunities, and drive alignment between finance, sales, marketing and operations. The role requires partnership at an executive level, ensuring the business's critical ""hot spots"" are addressed and that processes, numbers, and reporting are accurate and actionable.

This is a rare opportunity to have a seat at the table with the SLT, including the CFO, Sales Director, Marketing Director, and CEO, giving you direct exposure to decision-makers and the chance to shape the company's direction as it scales.

This is a hands-on mandate that will require you to be on the ""tools"" initially. Looking ahead 12 months, success will see you shifting 70% of your time to strategic insights and driving business outcomes, rather than building processes and pure reporting - truly elevating the finance function's impact on the business.



Responsibilities




FP&A: Lead forecasting, budgeting, and financial modelling to support business planning and decision-making across the ANZ portfolio
S&OP Leadership: Own the Sales & Operations Planning process, working cross-functionally to align planning, reporting, and operational execution with the Demand team
Strategic Insights & Reporting: Translate complex data into actionable insights, identifying hot spots, risks and opportunities to drive ROI and revenue growth management
Process Transformation: Design and implement improved reporting processes and frameworks, including Power BI initiatives, to provide the right visibility for stakeholders
Stakeholder Partnership: Work closely CFO, Sales Director, Marketing Director, and CEO to forecast performance and ensure insights translate into results
Cross-Functional Accountability: Drive accountability across teams, ensuring deadlines are met, actions are followed through, and processes are adhered to
Systems & Data Management: Work with IBM TM1, SAP Planning Analytics and Excel to manipulate and transform data, ensuring reporting accuracy from gross profit to net profit
Change Leadership: Navigate ambiguity and imperfection with resilience, driving process improvements and helping teams adapt to new ways of working during transformation



Candidate Profile



We are seeking a CA/CPA/CIMA qualified finance professional with deep FP&A expertise, ideally from FMCG or manufacturing environments (industry experience not essential). You will have navigated transformation initiatives and be comfortable working in imperfect environments while knowing what good looks like.

Your technical toolkit must include hands-on capability building robust Excel models and executive-ready PowerPoint packs. You bring a system builder mindset - someone who loves fixing structure, streamlining processes, and thriving in ambiguity with incomplete data.

Critical to success is your ability to integrate operational inputs into financial forecasts, work with Power BI or similar tools, and possess strong analytical judgement with ""connect the dots"" thinking. You can turn numbers into narrative, influence senior stakeholders, and drive cross-functional accountability without aggression.

You demonstrate an organisational discipline managing FP&A rhythms, can challenge respectfully, and balance driving deadlines with collaboration.



Company, Culture & Benefits



This organisation is an innovative and entrepreneurial large FMCG leader. They are genuinely focused on future growth, therefore creating rare opportunities for top finance professionals to shape how the business operates.

This role offers rare strategic influence and executive exposure, giving you a seat at the table with the SLT and the opportunity to drive meaningful change during a pivotal period. You'll work in a collaborative environment that values cross-functional partnership, with the autonomy to design and implement improved processes and reporting frameworks.

For the right candidate, this is a career-defining opportunity to elevate your impact, shift from reporting to strategic insights, and play a central role in transforming finance for a business with ambitious growth plans. If you're ready to step up, make your mark, and help shape the future of an Australian icon, this is the role for you.




Blue chip yet entrepreneurial FMCG leader with iconic brands; Be part of a business shaping Australia's food future
Drive insights that influence executive decision-making; Direct exposure to CFO, VP Sales, CMO and CEO

Together we’re driving to deliver our vision to provide our customers with financial security for a better retirement.

We achieve this goal by providing a work environment where people from diverse backgrounds, with a range of skills and experiences can contribute and succeed.

Valuations Analyst – Sydney 

We’ve created a brand-new role to strengthen how we independently validate private debt pricing  

Sitting alongside the Quant team, you’ll be the control point that keeps pricing accurate, on time, and defensible.  

If you like being the person who spots issues early, gets the detail right, and keeps everyone honest, this is very much your lane. 

We work flexibly from our Sydney CBD Office (Typically 3 days in office, 2 from home). 

About the role  

You will join a high performing team within the COO Office, which is tightly integrated across our investment teams and collaborates with multiple support functions to drive operational precision and agility. 

Operating alongside the Quantitative team, and functioning as an independent control, you will be central to pricing governance, daily unit pricing, and month-end reporting to the Valuation Committee. 

If you thrive on detail, work well to tight deadlines, and enjoy partnering with portfolio managers and external service providers, this role will suit you perfectly. 

What you’ll be across day-to-day 

Daily operations 

Run pre-9:30am checks on private debt pricing and control reports, digging into variances and data mismatches (think static data, curves, odd gaps). 

Handle price-threshold queries from State Street and our PMs as they come up - and keep things moving 

Book and load trades in Charles River, ironing out any trade-reporting issues before they land in someone else’s inbox. 

Flag issues early with a clear read on impact to unit pricing quality and SLA delivery. 

Month-end and governance: 

Pull together clean, reconciled packs for PMs and the Valuation Committee — and present the private debt reporting. 

Make sure final unit pricing reflects every required valuation within the deadlines. 

Present private debt price reporting to the Valuation Committee and implement directed pricing in internal systems. 

Support semi-annual sensitivity work and any ad-hoc pricing investigations. 

Technical / financial work: 

Maintain and troubleshoot models and reporting using advanced Excel (Power Query, macros, formulas). 

Apply foundational fixed-income knowledge across pricing, derivatives, and cash-flow discounting. 

Skills & experience you will need

You’ve got middle-office or fixed-income operations experience (bank, asset manager, investment admin) and ideally have exposure to private debt instruments. 

As well as;  

Comfort working under strict SLAs and regulatory oversight.  

Experience supporting governance processes (e.g. Valuation Committees) is advantageous 

Advanced Excel skills - (Power Query, macros), data querying and reconciliation. 

Your eye for detail is sharp, and you’re the kind of person who won’t move on until the numbers tie out. 

You communicate clearly, partner well with busy stakeholders, and know when to push back. 

Qualifications 

Bachelor’s degree in finance, Accounting, Economics or equivalent. 

Additional Information 

At Challenger, we’re small enough to be agile, but big enough to accelerate bold ideas. We support your growth and development, offering flexibility and a culture that values your unique contributions. 

Competitive discretionary bonus scheme 

18 weeks paid parental leave for all new parents 

Challenger Day – one extra day off every year in recognition of the effort our people make.
