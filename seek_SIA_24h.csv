You will work closely with stakeholders across Finance, Sustainability, Supply Chain, Technology Services, HR and regional teams to source, analyse, challenge and explain data, and to embed financial‑grade rigour into ESG reporting processes.

You will lead the preparation of key external disclosures, including emissions reporting within the Annual Report, the AASB‑compliant Climate Report, and European CSRD deliverables, and support assurance activities and Board‑level reporting. This role is based in Sydney CBD with flexible hybrid work arrangements.

Lead and develop team members while acting as a trusted subject‑matter expert across the business

What will ensure your success:

Deep expertise in carbon accounting and emissions reporting, ideally within a global or ASX‑listed organisation

Strong experience applying recognised frameworks such as the GHG Protocol, ISO standards or GLEC

Step into a key role within our Cyber Security Program Management team, where you’ll help drive the reduction of Alinta’s most critical cyber risks. Based in either Melbourne or Adelaide, you’ll engage closely with Technology, Risk, Security Operations and Compliance to understand the factors behind our cyber risks and guide the uplift required to resolve them.

Monitor project milestones, budgets, change management effectiveness and the adoption of security outcomes by control owners.
Prepare clear program updates and reporting for senior stakeholders, including the GM Security & Risk and the Audit & Risk Committee (ARC).

Your experience

Strong background in cybersecurity, ideally across risk, governance, compliance, or security operations, with hands-on experience implementing or uplifting security controls.
Experience delivering or overseeing technology or cyber-related projects or programs, with the ability to influence stakeholders and guide outcomes.
A solid understanding of cloud security (Azure/AWS), network security fundamentals, antimalware solutions, and encryption practices.
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to translate complex technical issues for non-technical audiences and build strong stakeholder relationships.
Strong analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, with the ability to operate calmly and effectively in dynamic, high-pressure environments.
