You’re a systems-focused professional with strong technical capability and the confidence to take ownership of complex workflows and reporting needs. You enjoy being hands-on and working directly with all employees with both Directors and frontline operators.

You will bring:

• Experience improving or integrating business systems (Kynection, simPRO, MYOB, Upvise, Pronto, or similar).

• Strong ability to break down workflows, map AS-IS processes, and design improved future-state processes.

• Hands-on capability with Power BI, including building dashboards, modelling data, connecting multiple systems, and translating operational data into actionable insights.

• Experience delivering automation, reporting improvements, or workflow simplification.

• Strong communication skills, able to engage Senior Leaders, Supervisors, and Field Teams.

• Solid analytical skills with the ability to turn operational problems into system solutions.

• Willingness to travel between NSW and QLD for discovery, training, and implementation work.

Experience in utilities, maintenance, construction, or service-based industries is highly regarded, but not essential. This role can be based from Ingleburn (NSW) or Stapylton (QLD) or Maroochydore (QLD).

Why PMA?

• A senior role with real autonomy, work with Senior Leaders including founding Directors

• Own the systems, the improvements, and the outcomes

• Flexibility to travel as needed and work independently

• Hands-on position in a business that wants practical results, not layers of complexity

• Major role in a genuine business transformation program

• Supportive team and strong operational culture
