In the Pilbara region of Western Australia, we own a world-class, integrated network of 17 mines, four independent port terminals, a rail network spanning nearly 2,000 kilometres and related infrastructure - all designed to respond rapidly to changes in demand. We are one of the world's leading producers and exporters of iron ore.

Our privately owned and operated rail network is an essential part of our integrated production process and services our 16 mines across the Pilbara via almost 2,000 km of track. With rail depots located at Tom Price, Cape Lambert and Dampier (7 Mile), most trains are autonomously operated and typically comprise three locomotives and 240 ore cars stretching to approximately 2.4 kilometres in length. We are also applying and adapting technology to improve safety and productivity across our rail network.

Who we are

Rio Tinto is a leading global mining and materials company. We operate in 35 countries where we produce iron ore, copper, aluminium, critical minerals and other materials needed for the global energy transition and for people, communities, and nations to thrive.

We have been mining for 150 years and operate with knowledge built up across generations and continents. Our purpose is finding better ways to provide the materials the world needs - striving for innovation and continuous improvement to produce materials with low emissions and to the right environmental, social and governance standards. But we can't do it on our own, so we're focused on creating partnerships to solve problems, create win-win and meet opportunities.
