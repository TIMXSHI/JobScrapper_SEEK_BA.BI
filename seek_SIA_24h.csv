Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora,你好, hallo, vítejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point. 

Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney, with a second campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, and Auckland, NZ. You have flexibility in how and where you work — whether that's from one of our spaces, from home, or a mix of both. This role is remote-friendly within Australia or New Zealand, so you can choose the setup that empowers you and your team to do your best work.

Job Description


About the team:
 

Canva's Design Generation systems use AI to create complete designs from text descriptions - turning user intent into layouts, images, typography, and color palettes. At scale, we generate millions of designs monthly, making reliable quality evaluation critical. The Design Generation Platform team (8 engineers) supports Design Generation infrastructure with focus on developer experience tooling, platform orchestration, and self-service capabilities. We own the plumbing that makes Design Generation systems observable, debuggable, and improvable.

Our philosophy: Platform owns orchestration, not application logic. We build reusable infrastructure that scales across Design Generation rather than solving one-off problems. We emphasize collaborative decision-making, evidence-based approaches, and building capabilities that serve researchers and engineers across Design Generation.

About the role:

As the Design Generation Evaluation owner, you'll build the infrastructure that enables quality monitoring across Design Generation. You're the expert who both understands evaluation methodologies deeply AND builds the infrastructure to scale them across the organization.

This role sits at the intersection of three critical areas:

Evaluation Strategy & Expertise: You'll guide Design Generation teams on how to evaluate their systems effectively - which methods work for different scenarios, how to set up robust test sets, when to use LLM-as-Judge vs. 1st Party Quality Models vs. user signals, and how to balance cost with detection speed. You'll establish evaluation best practices and patterns that teams can adopt.

Infrastructure & Scale: You'll build the platforms that make evaluation accessible and automated - alerting systems, continuous monitoring, production sampling, step-level harnesses. Your goal is enabling teams to run evaluations effortlessly, eventually integrating evaluation checks into Continuous Deployment so quality gates happen automatically.

Ecosystem Integration: Canva has multiple evaluation tools. You'll articulate how these pieces fit together for Design Generation, define clear integration points, and build the connective tissue that makes the evaluation story coherent rather than fragmented.

The challenge: Quality degradation in generative systems is subtle. Designs look slightly off-brand, layouts don't quite work, users stop publishing without clear signals. You'll need deep ML intuition to build detection systems that catch real issues while minimizing false positives. This role requires navigating ambiguity, making pragmatic architecture decisions, and building infrastructure that serves diverse evaluation needs across research and engineering.

What you’ll do (responsibilities)

Understand and optimize existing evaluation systems including LLM-as-Judge frameworks, visual quality models , and multi-dimensional scoring approaches - analyzing their strengths, limitations, and trade-offs to identify gaps in coverage and opportunities for improvement across brand adherence, visual appeal, layout quality, and functional correctness

Design and implement automated evaluation pipelines that score generated designs at scale, balancing accuracy with computational cost

Define evaluation strategies for different scenarios: pre-deployment validation, continuous monitoring, A/B experiment analysis, and model comparison

Curate high-quality evaluation datasets and benchmark suites that represent diverse use cases, edge cases, and quality dimensions

Integrate evaluation systems into continuous deployment pipelines, creating automated quality gates that catch regressions before production

Reduce evaluation cycle time to enable teams to iterate faster on model improvements and launch experiments earlier

Partner with research teams to understand evaluation needs for new model architectures and capabilities

Define the evaluation ecosystem strategy: how different evaluation tools and methods compose together for Design Generation

Guide teams on evaluation best practices, appropriate methodologies for their use cases, and interpretation of results

What we're looking for

Strong ML engineering fundamentals with experience building and maintaining production ML systems at scale

Proven ability to build robust, scalable infrastructure (not just models) - you're a platform engineer who speaks ML

Deep understanding of distributed systems, observability patterns, and monitoring best practices

Python proficiency with production-quality coding standards, code reviews, and testing practices

Experience with data pipelines, time-series data, and statistical analysis for detecting anomalies

SQL fluency for querying and analyzing large datasets across data warehouse and analytics systems

Track record of building self-service platforms or developer tooling that gets adoption

Excellent collaboration skills - this role requires working across teams to understand needs and deliver solutions

Experience with evaluation of Gen AI systems at scale (even better if that’s evaluation of systems with creative outputs!)

Additional Information


Don't tick all the boxes? Don't worry about that - nobody does!  We’d still love to hear from you! At Canva, we know that great engineers come from a variety of backgrounds, and we value passion, curiosity, and a willingness to learn just as much as specific experience.
