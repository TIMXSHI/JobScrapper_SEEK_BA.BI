Brisbane City Council is Australia’s largest local government, responsible for shaping one of the fastest growing capital cities in the country. Council’s Brisbane Vision 2031 sets out the city’s long term aspirations: to be safe, inclusive, prosperous and globally connected, while retaining the lifestyle, character and subtropical vibrancy that make Brisbane unique. 

In the lead up to the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Council is entering a defining era of transformation and reform. This is a once in a generation opportunity to deliver city shaping projects, integrated planning frameworks and sustainable economic development that will leave a lasting legacy. 

About the Role 

Reporting to the Chief Financial Officer, the Manager, Financial Planning and Analysis is a senior executive leadership role within Strategic Finance, positioned at the centre of financial decision-making for one of Australia’s largest and most complex local governments. 

You will lead the transformation of Council’s FP&A capability through modern planning frameworks, rolling forecasts, advanced financial modelling, digital tools and data-driven insights, ensuring finance is future focused, agile and decision relevant. 

This is an opportunity to shape how finance partners with the business. You will act as a visible and trusted advisor to executive and operational leaders, with a clear mandate to challenge assumptions, elevate financial literacy and strengthen decision-making discipline across Council. 

The role offers significant visibility across the organisation and the opportunity to influence outcomes that directly impact the future of Brisbane. As a member of Council’s executive leadership cohort, you will contribute beyond the FP&A function, participating in organisational strategy, governance and reform initiatives and supporting enterprise-wide performance excellence. 

Key aspects of the role include:

Driving continuous improvement in financial planning processes, systems and analytics capability 
Translating complex financial information into clear, practical insights that support confident and timely decisions 
Leading and developing a high-performing team while contributing to broader organisational strategy and transformation initiatives 
This role will suit a finance leader who enjoys operating in a complex environment, influencing beyond traditional finance boundaries and building capability across an organisation. It offers the opportunity to combine strategic thinking with tangible impact, supporting long-term financial sustainability and delivering value for the Brisbane community. 

As an Executive Service leader, you will contribute beyond the FP&A function, participating in whole-of-Council strategy, governance, reform and performance initiatives. This includes engaging with senior executives and elected members, and providing trusted, independent financial advice in complex, high-accountability environments. 

About You 

You are an experienced enterprise FP&A leader with strong financial planning and analysis capability and a demonstrated ability to influence decision-making in complex organisations. You bring a strategic mindset, balanced with strong operational understanding, and are comfortable working closely with senior executives to drive outcomes. 

You will demonstrate: 

Extensive experience in financial planning and analysis, budgeting and forecasting within a large or complex organisation 
Advanced financial modelling and scenario planning capability 
A strong track record of business partnering with executive and operational leaders 
The ability to translate complex financial data into clear commercial insights and recommendations 
Experience improving financial systems, processes or planning frameworks 
Strong stakeholder engagement and influencing skills across diverse groups 
A collaborative and people focused leadership style with experience building high performing teams 
A strong understanding of public sector governance, accountability frameworks and the unique challenges of local government finance 
Experience operating in, or closely with, highly regulated or public accountability environments, with a strong understanding of governance, stewardship and legislative context.
