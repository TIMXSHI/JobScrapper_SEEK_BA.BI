At Intelligen, we’re building something different. Over the past three years, we’ve evolved from a bold startup to a trusted partner for some of Australia’s most complex data transformations.

We’ve helped organisations move from legacy to modern platforms, embedded governance into decision-making, and brought AI into the hands of the business — responsibly and at speed.

But we’re just getting started. As we scale into our next phase of growth, we’re looking for Data Engineers who don’t just want to build pipelines but want to shape how modern data ecosystems come to life across Australia.

About the Role

We’re looking for a Data Consultant with solid experience in Microsoft Fabric to design, build, and optimise data solutions across modern cloud environments. You’ll work hands-on with Fabric’s Data Factory and Lakehouse components to create seamless data flows that empower analytics and AI at scale.

This role is ideal for someone who thrives on problem-solving, enjoys working across the full data lifecycle, and wants to make a measurable impact through clean, well-designed data architecture.

Key Responsibilities

Design, build, and maintain scalable data pipelines using Microsoft Fabric (Data Factory, Dataflow Gen2, Lakehouse).

Develop robust data models to support downstream analytics and self-service reporting.

Ingest, transform, and integrate structured and unstructured data from multiple sources.

Optimise data performance and reliability through monitoring, testing, and automation.

Collaborate closely with data analysts, architects, and clients to understand business requirements and deliver effective data solutions.

Contribute to standards and frameworks that promote best practices in data engineering, version control, and documentation.

Support the adoption of Fabric and modern data engineering practices within client teams.

Skills and Experience

4–6 years’ experience in data engineering or data platform development.

Hands-on experience with Microsoft Fabric, including pipeline orchestration, data modelling, and workspace management.

Strong proficiency in SQL and experience with Python or PySpark for data transformation.

Experience with Azure data services (Data Lake, Data Factory) or other modern cloud platforms (Snowflake, AWS, GCP).

Understanding of data modelling concepts, ELT/ETL patterns, and performance optimisation.

Familiarity with modern tooling such as dbt, Git, and CI/CD pipelines.

Excellent communication and collaboration skills — able to work confidently with both technical and business stakeholders.

What You’ll Bring

Curiosity and a problem-solving mindset — you enjoy understanding how things work and making them better.

A commitment to clean, scalable engineering practices and continuous learning.

A collaborative spirit — you enjoy working across teams to deliver real outcomes.

The confidence to share ideas, challenge the norm, and help build something better.

Why Intelligen?

We’re not just delivering AI and data projects — we’re humanising them. That means we care deeply about the how, not just the what. We value curiosity, creativity, and a willingness to challenge the status quo.

You’ll join a team that’s smart, kind, and ambitious — where you’ll have real influence in your projects, your practice, and our business. As we grow, so will you.

We’re building teams that are technically excellent, commercially focused, and client-first — consultants who are curious, collaborative, and eager to grow."

Help people create their tomorrow, while you create yours

We help people with their banking, super, retirement and finances. Through upturns, downturns, recessions, and major life transitions. Every day, we help people see and make more of their financial potential, so that they can create their tomorrow. And we've been doing it for over 170 years.

If we do our job well, we genuinely add to the prosperity of our country and its people.

How you'll make an impact

As a Senior Portfolio Analyst, you'll play a pivotal role in enabling AMP's enterprise-wide transformation by delivering actionable insights that drive strategic alignment, portfolio optimisation and value delivery. You'll be responsible for analysing and reporting on portfolio performance, supporting integrated planning and ensuring benefits realisation across complex change initiatives.

Why we think you'll love working at AMP

Doing what we've always done is not an option, so your clever ideas will get airtime here. You'll be encouraged to speak up and try new things. If they don't work, we move on - better for it.

We know there's no one way of doing things. So, you won't have to sacrifice who you are or how you work to fit in here. We're inclusive and flexible in many of the ways you'd expect. And in some of the ways you wouldn't. As long as your health and wellbeing come first - at home and at work.

In fact, most of what makes AMP such a welcoming, enjoyable place to work are our people. Wherever you go, you'll find moments to connect, feel valued and do meaningful work.

But in your current role, perhaps you feel boxed in - solving the same problems, working with legacy tools, and not given the platform to influence the bigger change you know is possible.

This is your chance to step into a leadership role where you’ll guide both stability today and transformation tomorrow. You’ll lead a capable team of application specialists with deep domain expertise while helping drive the shift from fragmented, legacy systems to modern, vendor-led platforms. It’s a hands-on position where your technical knowledge, leadership ability, and business engagement skills will all be tested and valued.

The organisation is on a journey: long-standing in-house applications are being phased out in favour of modern supply chain platforms. It’s a role that blends continuity and change, ensuring critical systems remain stable and reliable, while championing the adoption of new solutions that improve efficiency, integration, and customer outcomes.

What you’ll do

Lead and coordinate the day-to-day support of core supply chain applications (covering logistics, inventory, planning, and dispatch systems).
Act as the senior escalation point for critical incidents, providing hands-on investigation, diagnosis, and resolution.
Partner with business users (planners, coordinators, operations managers) to identify issues, deliver enhancements, and support process improvements.
Manage system upgrades, patches, and new features, ensuring testing, communication, and minimal disruption.
Mentor and guide a small, highly experienced team, encouraging knowledge sharing and continuous improvement.
Contribute to the long-term transformation program: helping transition away from legacy systems, supporting integration with modern platforms, and ensuring applications evolve with business needs.




What you’ll bring

10+ years’ application support experience, including at least 5 in supply chain or related operational systems.
Strong technical foundations: SQL, data flow analysis, troubleshooting, and system integrations.
Proven experience leading small teams while remaining hands-on and technically engaged.
Excellent communication and stakeholder management skills, with the ability to front the business and influence decisions.
Familiarity with ITIL practices and ITSM tools (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira).
Background in logistics, distribution, or manufacturing environments will be highly regarded.




Why this role

Impact now, shape the future: balance operational reliability with leading a platform transformation journey.
High visibility: supply chain systems are business-critical, your contribution will be recognised.
Lead experts: inherit and guide a team with deep domain knowledge and help them adapt to change.
Transformation journey: play a key role in shifting from legacy applications to modern, integrated platforms that support efficiency and growth.
