Proven analytical ability and commercial acumen - able to translate complex cost, regulatory and competitive factors into pricing recommendations.
Excellent communication skills, capable of simplifying complexity for senior leaders, technical teams and cross-functional stakeholders.
Experience working autonomously in environments that require process creation, system understanding and structured methodical execution.
Strong problem solving capability, with the ability to navigate ambiguity, work through incomplete information, and develop practical, commercially sound solutions
Energy retail or SME-segment experience (pricing, billing, settlements or product) highly desirable but not essential if you bring the right quantitative skills

Please note this role requires full working rights within Australia.
