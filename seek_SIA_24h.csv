This role is for someone who loves getting deep into data, but who also understands that the real value comes from how the story is told. You'll work closely with senior stakeholders, shaping decisions through clear, compelling, and credible insights.

What you'll be doing

Advanced SAS analytics: Use SAS as your core tool to interrogate large, complex datasets and uncover insights that matter.
Insights and storytelling: Translate analysis into clear narratives that influence decisions, not just dashboards and reports.
Business partnership: Work closely with stakeholders across the business to understand their challenges and deliver insights with genuine commercial impact.
Visualisation & reporting: Use tools such as Tableau (or similar) to bring insights to life for non-technical audiences.
Continuous improvement: Proactively identify opportunities to improve processes, methodologies, and the way insights are delivered.
About the team

You'll join a high-performing analytics team that is actively evolving toward a more data science-led environment. It's a space where strong technical foundations are valued, curiosity is encouraged, and you'll have the opportunity to grow your skills as the function matures.

What we're looking for

Proven experience in a Senior Insights Analyst (or similar) role.
Strong, hands-on SAS capability - this is a core requirement, not a nice-to-have.
Solid experience with SQL and data visualisation tools such as Tableau.
The ability to explain complex analysis in a way that resonates with senior, non-technical stakeholders.
A commercial mindset and a genuine passion for using data to influence outcomes.
Exposure to Python and/or R is advantageous but not essential.
Why apply?
This is an opportunity to work in an organisation where analytics genuinely influences strategy and decision-making. You'll have the platform to showcase your SAS expertise, sharpen your storytelling skills, and make a visible impact across the business.

If you're technically strong, commercially minded, and ready to turn data into decisions — we'd love to hear from you."
