At Acenda, we draw on over 135 years of heritage to empower a brighter future with security and confidence.

Our values-driven business strives for high performance and growth as we look towards the future. As part of the global Nippon Life Group, we will enhance our capabilities and further strengthen our enduring commitment to putting customers at the heart of everything we do. And to support our partners to do the same.

We believe that when people have the support, clarity, and confidence they need, they can do their best work and build a future they’re proud of. We encourage our people to take life on – inside and outside of work – to grow and make a real impact for our customers, partners, and each other.

The role

Reporting into the Head of Data and Analytics, the Data Engineering Manager role is a 12-month fixed term contract opportunity.

As Data Engineering Manager, you will be responsible for leading the data engineering practice at Acenda, defining and implementing strategies at acquiring data and promoting the implementation and deployment of the Acenda Enterprise Data Warehouse.

As we continue our integration journey with Resolution Life Australia, bringing two enterprise data warehouses together, you will play a critical role in achieving that whilst providing strategic inputs to the Data Engineering & Information Architecture Leadership Team.

You will be responsible for overseeing engineering best practices, implementing a disciplined Data Engineering operating model, building, and maintaining a reliable data platform based on efficient ETL processes.

In addition, you will define and monitor data engineering metrics, analyse data, and lead partnership with other Data and Analytics team members to implement data assets (data lake, data vault, data marts) and process improvements initiatives.

In this role, you will also lead a team of dedicated and specialised Data Engineers. You will be responsible for providing mentorship and guidance to enable your team to be continuously developed and challenged meaningfully, as well as plan and prioritise the pipeline of work and any other strategic initiatives to be delivered.

About you

You are an experienced Data Engineering Manager with a minimum of 5+ years of experience in a similar capacity.

While you possess the required leadership capabilities and have experience in leading a team, you still play a hands-on role in your previous roles, enabling you to tackle and lead any technical troubleshoot or problem-solving and analysis work from the front.

You are well-versed in using Informatica as a data engineering platform and ideally have experience using Snowflake in an AWS environment.

Lastly, you possess the ability to build and maintain strong relationships with a diverse group of stakeholders across the business, enabling you to influence and contribute to meaningful decision making.

Bringing our best to life - why join us?

·        We do work that makes a genuine difference to our customers, partners and community.

·        We have a supportive, inclusive and flexible team culture, including hybrid working.

·        We support your growth and development, and careers across our business units and teams that are as unique as our people.

·        We reward and celebrate our successes, through our incentive and recognition programs.

·        We offer tools, resources and benefits to support your wellbeing, including additional lifestyle leave and our Family Life hub.

·        We connect and celebrate our diversity at work through our social committees and employee groups, and we contribute to our community with paid volunteer leave and through our Reconciliation Action Plan and sustainability commitments.

We celebrate the diversity of our customers and community, and we embed diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging into how we do business. We encourage applications from people of all backgrounds, cultures, experiences, and identities.
