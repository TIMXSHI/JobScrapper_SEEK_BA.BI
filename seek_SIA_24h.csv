Support and improve reporting from ERP and field service platforms (e.g. Jobpac / construction ERP systems).
Operate effectively in a low-documentation environment, taking ownership of data discovery and structure.
Key Requirements   

Proven experience in a Data Analyst or similar role within complex, operational environments.
