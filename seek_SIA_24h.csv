Why we think you'll love working at AMP

Doing what we've always done is not an option, so your clever ideas will get airtime here. You'll be encouraged to speak up and try new things. If they don't work, we move on - better for it.

We know there's no one way of doing things. So, you won't have to sacrifice who you are or how you work to fit in here. We're inclusive and flexible in many of the ways you'd expect. And in some of the ways you wouldn't. As long as your health and wellbeing come first - at home and at work.

In fact, most of what makes AMP such a welcoming, enjoyable place to work are our people. Wherever you go, you'll find moments to connect, feel valued and do meaningful work.

Whether it's through our first-class leaders who are invested in you and your success. Through year-round opportunities to volunteer, fundraise and give back to the community. Or in the everyday challenges you face as we work together to strengthen this great organisation. Challenges that will stretch you, amplify your potential and compound the impact you have.



We believe in the power of inclusion and diversity

We're dedicated to fostering inclusion, diversity, and a warm feeling of belonging at AMP. It sparks creativity, ignites innovation, and turns up the dial on the quality of our decisions and performance. This not only makes our workplace more engaged but also leads to better connections with our customers.

We're your allies in the search for the perfect fit - when you apply, let us know how we can support you to put your best self forward during our selection process.

We're also committed to enhancing employment opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, so we enthusiastically encourage candidates from these backgrounds to apply and explore our Reconciliation Plan on our website.



Ready to create your tomorrow?

If you're someone who sees opportunity where others see challenge, come and work with us in smart, progressive ways as we transform an iconic Australian brand for the future. And, through a series of career-defining moments, create your own tomorrow.

Don't procrastinate! We review applications when we get them, and if we discover the ideal candidate, we may close the role earlier than the advertised close date.

Looking forward to meeting you."
