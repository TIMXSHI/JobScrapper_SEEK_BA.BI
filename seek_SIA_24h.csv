White Box Enterprises (WBE) is building a world where anyone who wants a job, can access one. To do this, we're on a mission to mainstream jobs-focused social enterprise.

Everything we do revolves around these 3 priorities. We:

Build large-scale social enterprises from the ground up;

Strengthen existing jobs-focused social enterprises to scale and grow; and

Innovate by leading advocacy and systems change initiatives to grow the sector.

Since we started, we've helped enable over 1000 jobs, incubated four social enterprises, raised $52M in blended finance for job creation projects, and built a powerful coalition of partners across sectors.

The role

We're looking for a Senior Strategy Lead who genuinely cares about enabling organisations to succeed — not just in the short term, but sustainably and meaningfully. In this role, you'll partner with purpose-driven teams, helping shape how they operate, deliver impact, and stay financially strong.

With your consulting background and your ability to bridge commercial thinking with social purpose, you'll work alongside Boards, leaders and frontline teams to shape strategy, execute transformation programs, and support people through change.

Partner with organisations to develop strategies to increase impact, capture growth opportunities, streamline operations and improve the organisation.

Co-design practical pathways from 'where we are' to 'where we want to be' — clear, feasible and mission-aligned.

Build genuine relationships with Boards, senior leaders, and teams, and walk side-by-side with them through change.

Pull together the right experts, internal and external, to execute on the plan — agile, collaborative, impact-oriented.

What you will bring (qualifications, experience and skills)

Solid consulting experience, especially in strategy development and/or business transformation.

A strategic mindset and the ability to translate complexity into clear, actionable plans people get.

Experience leading teams or mentoring others — you'll value collaboration, growth and support.

Excellent communication and stakeholder-management skills — you're comfortable in boardrooms and in the field.

Strong commercial acumen, balanced with a deep commitment to social purpose.

Understanding of, or willingness to learn about, employment barriers (e.g., people living with disability) and how to design for inclusion.

Bonus: experience working with social enterprises, disabnility, or purpose-driven consulting.
