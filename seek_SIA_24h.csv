The opportunity to join our team

At Insignia Financial, we’re serious about digital transformation. We’re investing heavily, moving quickly, and making real change. This role puts you at the centre of that journey, starting with a major website build and expanding into multiple platforms and systems as the program grows. If you’re tired of red tape and slow-moving machines, you’ll find this a place where your work lands fast and visibly.

We’re looking for a Digital Experience Business Analyst to join the team on a 12 month contract and bridge the gap between business needs, customer expectations, and delivery teams. You’ll bring clarity where things are fuzzy, keep vendors accountable, and help shape digital experiences that millions of Australians rely on.

What you’ll do
In this role, you’ll turn ideas and needs into clear, actionable requirements that guide delivery teams and vendors. You’ll:

·       Partner with stakeholders to gather, define, and document requirements for digital initiatives.

·       Translate business needs into structured functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria.

·       Validate requirements through development and testing, coordinate UAT, and ensure vendor delivery stays on track.

·       Serve as the bridge between business users, delivery teams, and partners by facilitating reviews, walkthroughs, and sign-offs.

 

What You Bring to This Role

You’ll succeed here if you can combine strong BA fundamentals with hands-on digital delivery experience. You’ll bring:

·       Deep BA experience in digital, data, or marketing technology environments.

·       Strong background in website implementations (CMS experience essential, AEM experience a plus).

·       Hands-on experience across MarTech and digital platforms – email, CMS, CDPs, personalisation, analytics, automation.

·       Ability to bridge technical and non-technical conversations with clear documentation.

·       Solid Agile experience with tools like JIRA and Confluence.

·       A customer-first mindset and the ability to keep digital experiences sharp, simple, and data-driven.
