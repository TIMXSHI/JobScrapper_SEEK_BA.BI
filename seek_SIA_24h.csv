Permanent Opportunity | Sydney CBD (Hybrid working - 3 days in the Sydney office)
Join a high-profile industry initiative.

We're seeking a Senior Business Analyst with deep experience in participant back-office replacement, divestment, or integration projects within the financial markets domain. This is an opportunity to play a pivotal role in the next release of a large-scale market infrastructure program.

We are looking for a senior business analyst who has worked on similar projects which involve a divestment of a participant such as CBA / Ausiex divestment, Etrade / CMC transition, CommSec / CommBank wholesale changes (including AUSIEX separation impacts), Sydney Stock Exchange (SSX) — onboarding/connectivity projects (e.g., new participant integrations, E*TRADE client connectivity through other brokers)

Candidates must have a minimum of 5-6 years of senior business analyst experience.

The Opportunity

Working within a collaborative delivery team, you'll bridge the gap between business and technical streams—focusing on industry testing and integration across multiple participant environments. This is not a standard BA role; it requires someone who understands the complexity of industry-wide testing, data schemas, and the connectivity challenges faced by brokers, settlement participants, and software providers.

You'll be responsible for:

Reviewing and validating functional and non-functional requirements for industry testing.

Designing and coordinating the industry test environment, ensuring it accurately simulates various participant types (brokers, settlement providers, custodians, etc.).

Creating and managing comprehensive test kits and test tools that enable software providers and participants to connect and validate end-to-end processes.

Working with the product and data teams to define data schemas, migrate data into the non-production environment, and create realistic test data sets.

Ensuring the test approach and supporting tools align with commitments made to market participants.

Leveraging tools and frameworks established in previous program releases, ensuring they are enhanced and fit for purpose.

About You

You'll bring proven experience as a Senior Business Analyst in large-scale financial market transformation programs, ideally within:

Participant back-office replacement, divestment, or acquisition/integration projects (e.g., similar to Ausiex / CBA or CMC / E*TRADE transitions).

Market infrastructure, clearing and settlement, or trading environments.

Designing or supporting industry-wide testing across non-production environments.

Working hands-on with data schemas, validation, and test data creation.

Intermediate level expertise in data and messaging is required for this position.

Strong analytical capability and stakeholder communication skills to engage confidently across business, product, and technical teams.

Candidates must hold permanent residency status to be eligible for this role.

Why Apply

This is a rare opportunity to contribute to an initiative reshaping how Australia's financial markets operate. You'll work with talented peers, gain exposure to complex market systems, and see your work have a tangible impact on how participants connect and operate across the ecosystem.

Founders Edge partners with established SME business owners (typically $1M–$10M+ in annual revenue) to help them scale with strategic precision and confidence. Our programs blend board-level strategy, financial modelling, and growth mentorship to help founders achieve extraordinary results — both in business and life.

The Role

We’re looking for a commercially savvy Business Analyst who can turn strategy into numbers — someone who thrives on mapping out how a business can grow over a 10-year horizon using leverage points such as pricing, lead generation, conversion rates, margins, capacity, and team structure.

You’ll work closely with our founder Ryll Burgin-Doyle and our coaching team to create and refine Revenue Resource Maps — dynamic spreadsheets that show business owners exactly how strategic tweaks compound into millions in additional profit and long-term value.

This role requires not just financial skill, but rapport, insight, and curiosity — the ability to engage with SME owners, understand their business model, and translate conversations into clear financial scenarios.

Key Responsibilities

Build and refine 10-year financial growth models (“Revenue Resource Maps”) tailored to each client’s business.



Work with coaches and clients to identify key leverage points for growth (pricing, margins, team utilisation, lead generation, etc.).



Translate qualitative strategy into quantitative outcomes (e.g., revenue targets, profit trajectories, team structure impacts).



Present findings in an engaging, plain-English way — bridging the gap between data and decision-making.



Ensure accuracy, clarity, and alignment with Founders Edge frameworks.



Contribute to ongoing refinement of the Revenue Resource Map templates and systems.



About You

Strong background in financial analysis, business modelling, or commercial advisory — ideally with SME experience (not just corporate).



Comfortable working directly with business owners and senior leaders.



Excellent communication and interpersonal skills — you can make numbers engaging and relevant.



You are excellent at working with Excel/Google Sheets skills; bonus if you can build or improve dynamic models.



Commercial understanding of growth drivers in service-based businesses (particularly building/construction, trade services, or professional services).



Highly organised, detail-oriented, and deadline-driven.



Strategic thinker who understands how to connect operational levers to long-term value creation.



Preferred Background

Experience in SME consulting, business coaching, or fractional CFO/Financial Controller roles.



Prior work in the building, construction, or trade services sector highly regarded.



Exposure to business strategy frameworks and business-growth models a plus.



What You’ll Get

Work directly with a world-class business strategist and her team.



Meaningful, high-impact work helping entrepreneurs grow and thrive.



Flexibility to work remotely, part-time, or full-time (depending on experience).



Competitive compensation with opportunity for ongoing engagement.




You’ll be part of a fast moving, fast growing company that is all about changing lives, transforming businesses and making a difference. We care for our clients deeply and each other.
