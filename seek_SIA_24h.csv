About the Role
The Commercial Strategy and Analytics Lead shapes and governs the commercial intelligence that underpins AEA’s most important strategic and operational decisions. The role exists to define what “good” looks like economically, guide sustainable growth and capital allocation, and translate pricing, workforce, and investment decisions into clear commercial outcomes. It blends strategic problem-solving, financial modelling, and advanced analytics to cut through noise and establish a defensible, data-led view of performance across the network.

Acting as the single source of commercial truth, this role owns enterprise commercial models, assumptions, and Business Intelligence strategy. It enables evidence-based decision-making by Executives and the Board and has the authority to challenge decisions not supported by data. While final decisions sit with leadership, this role is accountable for the quality, integrity, and coherence of the insights that inform them—allowing leaders to focus on deciding, not debating the data.

This is a full-time hybrid role based out of our Animal Emergency Australia Springwood office.

Key Responsibilities

Own long-term growth, capacity and investment models to guide network expansion, capital allocation and Board-level decisions.
Lead data-driven pricing and margin analysis, translating complex commercial trade-offs into clear, evidence-based decisions.
Develop workforce and remuneration models to support scalable growth, productivity improvements and informed people planning.
Provide rigorous commercial and financial modelling for major strategic initiatives, acting as a trusted internal advisory resource.
Own the BI strategy and tools, ensuring consistent metrics, strong governance, and executive-ready insights across the organisation.
Turn complex analysis into clear, actionable insights that strengthen executive decision-making and analytical maturity.

About You

Ex-consulting, commercial or pricing strategy background with strong commercial problem-solving discipline.
5–8+ years in strategy, commercial analytics, FP&A, or enterprise analytics roles.
Advanced financial modelling capability (long-range, scenario, sensitivity).
Strong BI and analytics fluency (Power BI essential; Anaplan highly desirable).
Comfortable operating across ambiguity, senior stakeholders, and competing priorities.
Credibility to challenge executives with evidence, not opinion.
Interested in an enterprise decision-enablement role (this is not a reporting role)
