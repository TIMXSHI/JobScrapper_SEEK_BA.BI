Nearmap is the Australian-founded, global tech pioneer innovating the location intelligence game. Customers rely on Nearmap for consistent, reliable, high-resolution imagery, insights, and answers to create meaningful change in the world and propel industries forward.

Harnessing its own patented camera systems, imagery capture, AI, geospatial tools, and advanced SaaS platforms, Nearmap stands as the definitive source of truth that shapes the livable world.

Job Description


Nearmap's Data Science team designs, prototypes, and develops machine learning products using Nearmap imagery data. As a Senior Data Scientist (Model R&D), you will own the statistical and practical performance of models that ship – framing problems, selecting modelling approaches, training and validating models, identifying failure modes, and improving results through modelling choices, data strategy, and disciplined evaluation. Off-the-shelf models, with minor fine tuning often do not suit our needs, so expect to be making complex decisions about problem formation/specification and model architecture. You will work closely with Machine Learning Engineers who build the training and deployment infrastructure. Your core accountability is the quality, robustness, and suitability of the predictions those tools produce.

Important: This is a hands-on modelling role focused on novel approaches to computer vision and deep learning. If your strength is dashboards, BI, reporting, classical modelling, or deployment of off-the-shelf models, this role is not the right fit for you.

What You’ll Do

Own the modelling lifecycle end-to-end: problem formulation → dataset strategy → training → evaluation → error analysis → improvement

Develop, or select and make novel adaptations to, model architectures for 2D/3D vision tasks using Nearmap’s multi-date, multi-angle, and 3D data
Use PyTorch and important associated packages and libraries (timm, xformers) to develop bespoke models that underlie Nearmap products.
Remain familiar with core conceptual elements of modern deep learning (attention, positional encoding, receptive field, pre-training), so that you can develop and adapt models to fit our needs.
Keep up to date with important developments in the field, such as innovations in the fields of vision and 3D
Design experiments and ablations to understand what drives performance and to de-risk model changes
Improve model performance through sampling strategies, labelling guidance, quality checks, and targeted collection for hard/rare cases
Work with ML Engineers to productionise models and ensure they are robust (monitoring, regression testing, reproducibility)
Communicate clearly about trade-offs, failure modes, and performance, primarily to technical stakeholders

Qualifications


Required

Background in a relevant discipline (Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, or similar)
Strong grasp of core ML fundamentals and the ability to explain them clearly (validation, regularisation, optimisation, over/underfitting, error analysis)
Hands-on experience training and evaluating ML models end-to-end, including designing baselines and iterating based on evidence
Strong coding ability in scientific Python in a Linux environment, using Git for source control
Demonstrated scientific rigour: forming hypotheses, designing experiments, and interpreting results using appropriate metrics and statistical reasoning
Experience delivering outcomes in real-world settings (shipping models, improving model quality over time, or delivering robust research prototypes)


Desirable

Computer vision experience (segmentation, detection, representation learning)
Experience working with geospatial data, aerial/satellite imagery, multi-view imagery, or multi-temporal imagery
Experience with 3D vision / photogrammetry / structure-from-motion, or working with point clouds / 3D meshes
Experience improving models via data strategy (label quality, sampling, active learning, hard-negative mining, dataset auditing)
Experience training at scale (GPUs, distributed training) and working with large datasets that require efficient IO and compute
Cloud computing experience (AWS or GCP)
Software engineering skills for contributing production-quality code to shared codebases (testing, reproducibility, documentation)


Personal Attributes

Curiosity and learning mindset: you keep your fundamentals fresh and stay up to date with modern deep learning
Pragmatism: you are capable of novelty and creativity, but not for its own sake: you prioritise solutions that work and ship over novelty
Strong judgment and “model taste”: you can choose sensible baselines, interpret failures, and iterate effectively
Collaboration: you communicate well, share knowledge, and work effectively in teams

Additional Information


Some of our benefits

Nearmap takes a holistic approach to our employees’ emotional, physical and financial wellness. Some of our current benefits include:
