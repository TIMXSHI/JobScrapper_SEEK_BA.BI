Simulation-Based Robotics

About us

We are an early-stage Australian tech venture developing a number of emerging robotic and human augmentation technologies for socially responsible and high-demand sectors in Australia. We are a small but strong and experienced team, combining diverse backgrounds and global expertise in software and hardware, AI, and systems integration across industries. Fully backed by private venture capital, we are finalising our corporate structure while preparing for an ambitious expansion into several relevant business areas. We want to engage the right candidate early, so that when we go full-scale we already have the leadership in place to move fast.

One of our missions is to help advance modern robotics adoption across Australian businesses in a cost-effective and scalable way. We leverage advanced physics-aware AI and software-defined simulation technologies, combined with affordable robotic hardware platforms, to go beyond trivial robotic engagement scenarios toward real commercial applications. By focusing on software-defined training and optimising the software stack, we accelerate the deployment of new-generation robotic solutions across key business areas, while lowering overall solution costs.

We are a socially responsible team, and want not only to generate revenue streams, but also make a meaningful impact on local communities, industries, and progress across Australia and globally.

About role

We are looking for an experienced and motivated leader in software engineering with a strong track record of building compute-intensive applications, not necessarily in robotics.

You will apply your diverse expertise while acquiring new domain knowledge, becoming the bridge between our strategic leadership and technology teams, and helping us bring the technology to life.

In this role, you will:

Steer software methodology development to ensure a viable and scalable product, as a member of our expert leadership team;

Implement perception and SLAM software pipelines, including environment capture, photogrammetry, and digital twinning, together with the hardware team;

Implement motion capture and skeletal kinematic reconstruction, together with the hardware team;

Implement embodied AI pipelines, including policy learning and hybrid model predictive control / whole-body control using modern optimisation frameworks, together with the hardware team;

Build and grow the backend and frontend software engineering teams from the ground up;

Collaborate tightly with the hardware engineering team;

Oversee the design and implementation of physics-aware, software-defined training pipelines on a daily basis;

Communicate our technologies clearly to stakeholders and external investors, aligning our technical roadmap with business needs.

Important: this is a technical position that combines stakeholder communication with hands-on engineering. You will be expected to balance your time between both.

About you

We are looking for someone who is intellectually and technically curious, strategically minded, and thrives in a collaborative and agile startup environment.

To be successful in this position, you will have:

10+ years of experience in one or more of the relevant fields mentioned above, including at least 3 years in a leadership role, preferably in a startup setting;

Strong ability to navigate uncertainty and communicate creative solutions to complex problems;

A track record of leading engineering teams and building products from the ground up;

Hands-on software engineering experience with modern frameworks and mainstream languages, such as Python, C#, C/C++, Go, or Rust;

Hands-on experience with mainstream scientific and engineering numerical simulation environments, such as MATLAB/Simulink, ANSYS, COMSOL, SolidWorks, Inventor, or others;

A self-starter attitude with strong analytical, creative, and planning skills;

Strong ability to work autonomously as part of a small but highly technical and agile team.

Any of the following skills will be a strong advantage:

Experience with generic simulation platforms, such as MATLAB/Simulink;

Experience with specialised robotics frameworks and platforms, such as ROS(2), MuJoCo, OCS2, or Isaac Sim;

Experience with modern CV, photogrammetry, perception, and SLAM frameworks, including PyTorch, OpenCV, AliceVision, or TensorFlow;

Experience with embodied-AI approaches, including policy learning, model predictive control, and whole-body control frameworks;

Experience with skeletons and rigging for gaming and video production, including inverse kinematics and motion-capture pipelines;

Experience with 3D game engines, such as Unreal Engine C++;

Experience with cloud computing platforms and data processing pipelines, including AWS, GCP, or Azure;

Experience with running and scaling distributed engineering teams;

Fluency in one or more foreign languages.

Other than these specific areas of robotics, experience in the following adjacent domains will also be considered, provided you can catch up on the domain quickly and deliver effectively:

Computer vision, perception systems, navigation, and SLAM;

Real-time 3D game engineering and physics engines;

Mechanical and scientific simulations, including CFD, FEM, multi-body dynamics, or thermodynamics;

Large-scale data processing, ML pipelines, and distributed systems.

About offer

We want to provide our most valuable asset, people, with a working environment that is both professionally and personally rewarding. We offer competitive compensation and an equity-sharing scheme to recognise your genuine contribution.

We welcome people from diverse backgrounds, provided they bring exceptional capability, fit our team culture, and add to it in a fast startup environment.

While we are launching in Australia initially from Brisbane and Adelaide, we are also open to hybrid or remote working arrangements for talented candidates based anywhere in Australia or within Asia-Pacific time zones, as long as they can be onsite for joint work with the software and hardware teams when needed.
