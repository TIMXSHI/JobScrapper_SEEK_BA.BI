This isn't just about chatbots or proof-of-concepts. This is enterprise-level AI transformation across customer, network, fraud, operations, and beyond. And they're not looking for someone to follow the roadmap - they're looking for someone to write it.

If you've been stuck on the sidelines, watching organisations play it safe, now's your chance to get on the pitch and architect something that actually matters.




What you'll be doing:
Define and own the AI architecture strategy across a multi-billion dollar organisation.
Lead the design of scalable, production-ready AI/ML solutions across multiple domains (yes, including GenAI - but not only GenAI).
Partner with product, data, and engineering leaders to make things happen. No siloes. No lip service.
Embed responsible AI frameworks - because scale without governance isn't innovation, it's a time bomb.
Be the voice that translates technical complexity into boardroom clarity.


What you bring:
A track record of building real-world AI systems - not just lab experiments or vendor demos.
Deep knowledge across ML ops, model lifecycle, cloud platforms (GCP/AWS/Azure), and LLMs.
Gravitas. You can hold your own with engineers and executives - and know when to challenge both.
Telco experience? Great. But if you've worked in any complex, regulated, data-heavy environment, you'll fit right in.

What's in it for you:
A seat at the table. This team has top-down backing and budget to build properly.
A chance to shape AI capability from the ground up
Flexible work, strong package, and a leadership team that actually gets it.


If you're tired of spinning your wheels, this is your chance to do something that moves the needle.
