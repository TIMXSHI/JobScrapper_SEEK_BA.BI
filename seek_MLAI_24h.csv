Today, Rapid Circle is a globally recognised, AI-focused digital transformation company with a strong presence in the Netherlands, India, and Australia. We specialise in harnessing the power of Microsoft technologies — including Azure, Microsoft 365, and Copilot — to empower organisations and their people.

Our commitment to innovation and excellence has been recognised with numerous accolades, including the Microsoft Global Partner of the Year Award for Frontline Workers in 2022, and most recently, recognition in the 2024 Microsoft Partner of the Year Awards.

At Rapid Circle, we don’t just keep up with change — we'll help you achieve what's next.
