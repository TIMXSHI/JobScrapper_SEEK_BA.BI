About Us

Canberra Consulting supplies highly skilled professionals across government and enterprise. We focus on fit for both clients and candidates, and we support you to thrive in high-impact delivery environments.

The Opportunity

The Cloud Infrastructure, Architecture and Strategy team is transforming to deliver the Department's Digital Strategy 2025–2030. We are seeking two EL1-equivalent architects for an initial contract to 30 June 2026, with two extension options (up to 12 months each).

This procurement covers two priority capability streams:

Cloud Architect (Primary Priority): Lead the design of the department's future-state cloud capability, including the Cloud Operating Model, Azure Landing Zone architecture, SaaS lifecycle roadmaps, and legacy migration into cloud-native or hybrid environments.

Data Architect (Primary Priority, with data engineering depth): Design the strategy to consolidate legacy data stores into a unified modern cloud data platform, with hands-on architectural capability across ETL/ELT, data pipelines, and technical data governance to scale enterprise analytics and AI.

Candidates with additional Solution or Security Architecture experience are welcome, but these are secondary.

Key Responsibilities
Cloud Architect (Azure)

Define the future-state cloud capability, including Cloud Operating Model and Landing Zone architecture.

Develop lifecycle roadmaps for the SaaS portfolio to prevent platform sprawl and maintain architectural coherence.

Architect modern data ingestion and transformation patterns (ETL/ELT), including pipelines and data flows (for example Azure Data Factory, Databricks).

Design for scale across enterprise analytics and AI use cases.

Define technical data governance standards and support adoption via governance forums.

Shared expectations (both roles)

Apply enterprise architectural frameworks and produce high-quality artefacts (HLDs, blueprints, roadmaps).

Translate complex concepts for senior non-technical stakeholders and negotiate with vendors and delivery partners.

Operate effectively in (or help establish) governance boards and design authorities (e.g., ARB).

Essential Criteria (what you’ll need)

Demonstrated experience applying architectural frameworks in complex environments (e.g., TOGAF, SABSA, DAMA).

Deep technical capability in Microsoft Azure, designing secure, scalable cloud solutions.

Strong communication and influence, including executive-level engagement and vendor negotiation.

Strategic mindset: roadmaps, lifecycle management, and moving beyond “fix-it” operations.

Proven experience operating within architectural governance (ARB/design authorities).

Australian citizenship and ability to obtain Baseline clearance.

Job Description


About the Group/Team

Canva's AI Platform Group serves as the foundation for AI innovation across the company, and achieving our GenAI ambitions depends on its ability to scale effectively. Within this group, the AI Enablement teams provide critical support to researchers and AI builders globally, helping them navigate platform capabilities, apply expert domain knowledge, optimise implementations, and accelerate the journey from experimentation to production. These teams bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and reliable, production-ready features, ensuring that innovation translates into real user value.

About the Role/Specialty

This role sits at the intersection of solution expertise and platform engineering, requiring deep technical expertise across ML domains combined with strong platform knowledge. The senior MLE will context-switch between debugging complex AI implementations, optimising inference performance, working directly with product teams building solutions, and developing blueprints that allow others to follow proven patterns.

The nature of enablement work demands someone who operates as a force multiplier, finding satisfaction not just in solving technical problems but in enabling others to move faster. The role operates in a high-velocity environment where priorities shift rapidly based on team needs, requiring both technical excellence and pragmatic judgment about when to invest in robust solutions versus rapid unblocking. This combination of deep expertise and adaptive problem-solving is critical to accelerating the delivery of GenAI capabilities across Canva, removing friction from the path to production and ensuring product teams across the company can ship AI-powered features at the pace and quality our ambitions require.

What you’ll do (responsibilities)
Responsibilities will evolve as Canva's needs change, but here's what the role will focus on initially:

Act as a solution expert across ML domains including evaluations, training, inference, data pipelines, quality, and optimisation

Work directly alongside product teams as a trusted partner, helping them navigate technical challenges and arrive at effective solutions

Provide expert guidance on platform capabilities, helping teams understand what's possible and how to get there efficiently

Develop blueprints, patterns, and paved roads that allow other teams to follow proven approaches and accelerate their own implementations

Debug and resolve complex issues, identifying root causes and sharing learnings broadly

Balance hands-on problem solving with strategic thinking about how to scale enablement impact across the organisation

You're probably a match if you have any of the following:

Demonstrated Python expertise with experience in ML frameworks

Commercial experience working with Kubernetes (K8s)

Experience or knowledge of building data pipelines

Experience or knowledge of model evaluations

Experience with inference optimisation and serving infrastructure

Experience supporting or working closely with research, data science, or product teams

Excellent debugging and problem-solving skills across the full ML stack

Ability to context-switch effectively across multiple concurrent projects

Proven communication skills with the ability to explain complex technical concepts to varied audiences

A collaborative mindset with a focus on enabling others to succeed
