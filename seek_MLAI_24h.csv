Company Insights

Join a genuinely supportive team where you’re valued, heard, and encouraged to grow. You’ll work with leaders who care, colleagues who collaborate, and a culture that celebrates learning and development.

Our client is a well-established boutique IT services provider specialising in the Architecture and Design industry. Their clients rely on high-performance systems: large 3D models, CAD/BIM workflows, GPU workstations, virtualised environments, and enterprise-grade storage. This means the engineering work is meaningful, complex, and technically rewarding — not basic helpdesk tasks.
You’ll also gain exposure to organisations using 3D design tools, Revit/AutoCAD, BIM platforms, SAN/NAS environments, and advanced virtualisation setups.

This is a low-ego, long-tenure team (many 5+ years) with flexibility, WFH options, and a city-centre office close to transport and great cafés.
  
About the Role

You’ll step into a senior engineering position where you act as the technical escalation point for complex issues and take the lead on project delivery. Your work will include building, configuring, and maintaining server and storage environments, virtualisation stacks, advanced networking, structured troubleshooting, and modern cloud setups.

A growing part of the role also involves helping clients adopt AI tools, Copilot integrations, internal chat systems, and automation workflows that improve efficiency and performance.

You’ll thrive here if you enjoy complex technical challenges, ownership, and shaping the next generation of infrastructure and AI-enabled solutions for clients.
  
Responsibilities

Resolve complex technical issues escalated from L1/L2 across servers, storage, virtualisation, and networking
Configure, deploy, and maintain virtualised environments (VMware or Hyper-V)
Manage SAN/NAS storage environments supporting large CAD/BIM datasets
Build and support Windows Server, Active Directory, Group Policy, Azure AD
Design and implement AI-enabled systems (Microsoft Copilot, M365 AI tools, internal chat systems, automation workflows)
Troubleshoot advanced networking: switching, routing, VLANs, firewalls, VPNs
Lead project deployments including server upgrades, migrations, cloud transitions (Azure), and network improvements
Maintain clear documentation across AI integrations, system setups, and best practices
Support and coach L1/L2 engineers through escalations
Deliver consistently high-quality support and ensure SLAs are met
Stay current with emerging tech, especially AI, virtualisation, and Microsoft platforms
 
About You

You’re a problem-solver who takes ownership, thinks strategically, and enjoys digging into root-cause analysis rather than quick fixes. You’re excited about where the industry is heading — AI, automation, smarter systems — and you want to be part of shaping that future.

Ideally, you bring:

5+ years’ experience operating at Level 3 within an MSP / IT services environment
Interest in AI integration — Copilot, chatbots, and automation workflows
Excellent communication and client-facing skills
A proactive, curious mindset and genuine love for learning
Strong experience with Microsoft 365, Azure, and modern workplace tools
Deep virtualisation experience (VMware or Hyper-V)
Experience with SAN/NAS storage systems
Strong infrastructure skills: Windows Server, AD/Group Policy, Azure AD, security, backups, migrations
Solid networking knowledge (TCP/IP, VLANs, routing, VPNs, firewalls)
Experience supporting project delivery across servers, networks, and cloud
