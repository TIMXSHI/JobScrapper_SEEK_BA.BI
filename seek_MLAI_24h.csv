Deliver AI initiatives that build user confidence, simplify adoption, and realise tangible business value.
Ensure end-to-end delivery of AI projects—primarily leveraging vendor-provided solutions and low-code platforms—by aligning with Australian Unity's AI Governance Procedures and actively collaborating with cross-functional teams and stakeholders.
Apply AI governance frameworks, guardrails, and risk/compliance standards consistently across project design and delivery.
Ensure all solutions are robust, well-documented, and aligned with enterprise standards
Provide specialist expertise, define enterprise-level AI frameworks / target state architecture in at least one of AI literacy & change management, AI governance or AIOps process optimization

About You:

To be successful in the role you will be able to demonstrate the following capabilities / experience:

Degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Science, Business, or other fields relevant to the role
Substantial professional experience (5+ years), including demonstrated success in consulting, business-facing, or technology enablement roles. Experience within industries such as health, insurance, banking, or wealth & capital markets is desirable.
