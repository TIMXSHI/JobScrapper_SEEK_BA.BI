This is not a role for someone chasing hype. It is for an engineer who wants to work at the intersection of real-world data, applied research, and production-grade software. You will join a well-established SaaS business building intelligent computer vision products used in high-consequence environments. The work matters. Accuracy matters. Thoughtful engineering matters. The focus is on understanding, analysing, and extracting meaning from visual data, not generating it. You will work with large language models, vision systems, and existing open-source frameworks to evaluate, compare, and assemble the right solutions. This is about engineering judgement, not reinventing the wheel. The team values people who can think deeply, test assumptions, and move from research to working product. You will have space to explore, but the expectation is delivery.

What you will be doing
Designing and building machine learning solutions for computer vision products
Evaluating and integrating existing open-source models and frameworks
Comparing and validating multiple LLM and vision approaches to determine best fit
Translating research insights into scalable, production-ready systems
Working closely with software engineers to embed ML capability into SaaS platforms
Balancing experimentation with clear outcomes and commercial impact
What they are looking for
Strong experience in machine learning with a research-oriented mindset
Hands-on experience with computer vision and image analysis
Proficiency in Python, with exposure to C++ highly regarded
Comfort working with large language models and modern ML tooling
Ability to reason deeply, communicate clearly, and build practical solutions
Background in research, robotics, or advanced ML is a strong advantage
The environment
Product-led SaaS business with real customers and real problems
Engineers trusted to think, test, and build
Strong technical peers and low ego culture
Flexible working with autonomy and accountability
Opportunity to shape foundational ML capability, not bolt it on
If you are an ML engineer who enjoys thinking as much as building, and wants your work to ship into real products, this is a rare opportunity worth exploring. Please share your resume and quote #269339 to apply.
