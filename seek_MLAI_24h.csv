This is a hands-on role in a collaborative team, working closely with our electronics and mechanical teams across firmware and controls, with the autonomy and accountability to turn a world-class design into a market-leading product, and share in the company’s upside as the product succeeds.


Key Responsibilities

· System Design: Work closely with the hardware and control teams to define system requirements, hardware interfaces, and software architecture.

· Embedded Software Ownership: Develop real-time embedded software that implements precise control of high-speed electromagnetic systems, from concept through integration and test. Contribute to desktop-side applications by leveraging Python for data visualization, test automation, and simulation tools that support firmware validation and debugging.

· Systems Integration: Lead the bring-up, integration, and validation of embedded software with hardware prototypes and test rigs. Collaborate closely with the electronics and mechanical teams to debug real-time control issues, verify system performance, and refine algorithms. Build and maintain automated test and validation procedures to ensure robust, repeatable performance as firmware and hardware evolve.

· Documentation & Revision Control: Maintain rigorous version control, documentation, and traceability of firmware revisions, test results, and design decisions to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and continuous improvement as the system evolves.

· Innovative Problem Solving: Take initiative to identify challenges and opportunities for improvement, developing creative solutions and contributing innovative ideas that advance our product’s performance, efficiency, reliability and scalability.

What You’ll Bring

· Technical Expertise:

Degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Mechatronics or related discipline

5+ years of professional experience developing real-time embedded software in C/C++, ideally across multiple product domains or hardware platforms.

Demonstrated ability to apply structured software engineering principles, including modular design, code reviews, and automated build/test systems, to deliver maintainable, high-quality code.

Experience developing embedded software optimised for memory and performance constraints in limited resource environments.

Strong understanding of control systems and feedback loops, with experience implementing and tuning real-time algorithms for motors, actuators, or other dynamic systems.

Skilled in implementing and debugging hardware communication interfaces (USB, I2C, SPI, UART) and troubleshooting embedded systems with tools like oscilloscopes, logic analysers, and serial tools.

Experience with Python for test automation, data visualization, and scripting to support firmware validation.

Ability to read and review electronic schematics and circuit designs.

· Collaboration:

Proven ability to work effectively in cross-functional teams and complex projects.

Practical, detail-oriented engineer who designs with production and assembly in mind.

Effective communicator who thrives in a collaborative, multidisciplinary environment, and can articulate technical ideas clearly and help guide decision-making.

· Problem-Solving Mindset:

A proactive, self-starting attitude with a passion for tackling challenges and creating solutions.

Experience optimizing systems for cost and performance, with a focus on cohesive, integrated designs.

Preferred Qualifications

Experience with TI microcontrollers.

Familiarity with MATLAB/Simulink or similar tools for control modelling, simulation and code generation.

·         Familiarity with control loops and PID controllers.

Familiarity with inverter control, motor drives, or power electronics systems is advantageous.

Experience with Building Management System integrations.
