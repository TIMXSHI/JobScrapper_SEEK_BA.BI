Tiddalik – our on-premises large language model ChatBot
Katapult – our robust software and machine learning development platform

We’re increasingly embedded in DSTG’s research community, shaping the future of Defence science through collaboration, creativity, and technical excellence.

If you're a self-starter who thrives in dynamic teams and wants to work on meaningful tech that matters — we want to hear from you.

Role 1 – S&T5 Senior DevOps Specialist

Shape the future of Defence software engineering.

Join a small, elite team of DevOps innovators driving modern software development across DSTG. As a Senior DevOps Specialist, you’ll be at the heart of a mission-critical capability — enabling researchers to build, deploy, and scale software using cutting-edge tools and practices.

This isn’t just support — it’s transformation. You’ll work alongside passionate technologists from diverse backgrounds, helping uplift DevSecOps maturity across DSTG. Our team leads by example, embracing modern engineering principles and continuously exploring new technologies to stay ahead of the curve.
