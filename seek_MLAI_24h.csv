Bachelor or Masters degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or a related field, or equivalent skills gained through 3-5 years of work experience. Advanced qualifications including a PhD are an advantage.

Experience with generative models: Proficient in working with large language models (LLMs), diffusion models, and multimodal architectures to develop innovative solutions.

Skills in training generative models: Experienced in techniques such as fine-tuning, in-context learning, and reinforcement learning to optimise model performance.

Proficiency in deep learning frameworks: Skilled in leveraging tools like PyTorch, JAX, and HuggingFace for advanced research and experimentation.

Expertise in experimental design and evaluation: Capable of implementing experimental design strategies for generative models, using both quantitative metrics and qualitative analysis to assess outcomes.

Ability to enhance research tooling and workflows: Experienced in rapid prototyping, conducting ablation studies, and tracking experiments to streamline research processes.

Competence in data curation and analysis: Adept at managing and analysing datasets for training and evaluating generative systems.

Familiarity with current research literature: Skilled at reproducing impactful papers and applying novel techniques to address emerging problem spaces.
