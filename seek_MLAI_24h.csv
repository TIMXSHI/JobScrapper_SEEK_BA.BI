Smiling Mind has been at the forefront of mental wellbeing innovation for over 12 years, helping minds thrive with evidence-based tools and resources. We’re proud to have impacted the lives of millions of people globally.

Our mission is Lifelong Mental Fitness. We aim to create generational change in mental health, providing proactive tools and programs that help every mind thrive. So far, we’ve reached more than 9.3 million people through our renowned mental fitness app and more than 14 million young people through our app and school based programs - but this is just the beginning.




ROLE OVERVIEW

We’re looking for a hands-on, curious and future-focused data engineer to join our growing product team. Your role is to help us:

Manage and evolve our internal data pipelines and metrics systems

Build tools and automation to reduce ad hoc data wrangling

Generate meaningful insights to support educators, researchers and funders

Lay the foundations for more scalable, self-serve and AI-enabled reporting

You’ll work closely with the product, research and commercial teams — and play a key part in transforming how data supports strategy and impact at Smiling Mind.




KEY RESPONSIBILITIES

Data Pipelines & Infrastructure

Build and maintain reliable ELT/ETL pipelines across product analytics (e.g. Amplitude), app backend, CRM (Hubspot), surveys (Qualtrics) and support tools (Freshdesk)

Use tools like dbt, Alteryx, or custom scripts (e.g. Replit or GenAI wrappers) to transform and standardise data

Maintain and enhance our BigQuery warehouse as a trusted, well-governed source of truth

Implement and monitor data quality rules, lineage, observability and retention policies

Automation & Self-Service

Collaborate with the COO and product team to build AI-assisted internal tools (e.g. MetricsGPT) that reduce data bottlenecks and support self-serve insights

Identify manual reporting tasks and automate them thoughtfully with an emphasis on accuracy, transparency and maintainability

Insights & Storytelling

Work closely with research and commercial teams to surface insights for school programs, grants, philanthropic funders and strategic partnerships

Translate complex datasets into clear, credible narratives and visualisations

Support product and strategy teams with dashboards, funnel analysis, retention tracking and program impact metrics




TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

Proficiency with SQL and BigQuery (or similar warehouses)

Experience with dbt, Alteryx, or data orchestration tools (Airflow, Dagster)

Familiar with Amplitude

Familiarity with APIs and custom data integrations (e.g. Amplitude, Hubspot, Qualtrics)

Knowledge of data observability, testing and quality frameworks

Interest in using GenAI tools to reduce data grunt work and enable insight creation

Bonus: familiarity with Looker Studio, Metabase, Replit, or scripting languages (Python/JavaScript)




MINDSET AND CAPABILITIES 

You’re curious, love to learn, and excited about emerging tools and AI-enabled workflows

You’re comfortable with ambiguity and can help bring structure to evolving needs

You care about impact, ethics, and using data responsibly

You love making data useful, trustworthy, and beautiful




THE VALUES WE LIVE BY AT SMILING MIND

100% People-first: We are dedicated to creating impact with people at the centre of everything we do. 

Change-makers: We challenge the status quo and pave new paths towards helping every mind thrive.

Curious: We ask questions and we strive to keep learning and improving. 

Intentional: We know action is required to achieve our goals and we’re purposeful in every action we take.




WE LOVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

A belief in the purpose and philosophy of Smiling Mind - that we can achieve generational change in mental health by focusing on building mental fitness skills in young people and the adults that surround them

A desire to have a positive impact on the world – particularly through behaviour change and learning design

The ability to blend agility and pace, with the rigour required to deliver impactful health services

A growth mindset and willingness to learn

Attention to detail, accountability, and ability to work to timelines and manage competing tasks

A warm, friendly, collaborative, and engaging approach 

Alignment to our values 

We're a friendly and highly driven small team with a big dream so expect to be surrounded by people who are passionate about changing the future generations of Australians. 'Smart Hustle' is a state of mind in a not-for-profit, but we are certainly not your standard. Smiling Mind is a high growth, fast paced organisation more akin to a tech start-up than what you might perceive a not-for-profit to be like.

Our people have tenacity, creativity, and resilience in spades, meaning we punch well above our weight, working together as a tight knit team to achieve great things.

You will be supported to succeed, but encouraged  to use initiative to get the job done, will be challenged to perform at your very best, and in return get the opportunity to learn from inspiring and skilled team members achieving life changing results for our community.

Other perks include a hybrid work environment, your birthday off each year, planned development days each quarter, salary sacrificing and a Collingwood based warehouse office which is most definitely dog friendly.

Smiling Mind is a child safe organisation and is committed to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all children, at all times. All offers of employment are subject to satisfactory background checks including, but not limited to, Working with Children Check and Referee Checks.

All employees are required to adhere to Smiling Mind's Code of Conduct, Policies & Procedures, and relevant Clinical & Technical Governance frameworks. Additionally, all activities must comply with the National Digital Mental Health Standards to ensure safe, ethical, and high-quality service delivery and operational integrity.

We are committed to creating a workplace that promotes mutual learning, respect, dignity, cultural openness and an appreciation of differing perspectives and backgrounds. We encourage applications from all people regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, cultural background, or sexual orientation. It is our goal that Smiling Mind continues to evolve as a culturally safe and welcoming organisation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, young people, families, and communities. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are encouraged to apply for this position."
