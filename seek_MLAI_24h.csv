Location: Sydney, Australia (Remote/Hybrid)
Type: Full-time (or contract-to-perm)
Comp: Below-market salary + meaningful equity (details shared with shortlisted candidates)
Stage: Fully funded startup | Existing product in market | Entering scale-up hardening phase

The opportunity

Alice/AI is building the platform that gives SME owners back 15+ hours per week by automating the operational work that currently lives across disconnected tools (email, calendars, files, CRM/accounting). We've built the core agentic AI engine and now we're entering a critical phase: architectural hardening, security uplift, and deep integrations into the systems our customers live in every day.

If you're a senior, hands-on engineer who enjoys turning a promising platform into a production-ready system—and you're open to a startup-style package (lower cash, higher upside via equity)—we'd love to talk.

What you'll do (high impact, hands-on)

You'll operate as a CTO/Lean Engineering Lead: with a product focus, making pragmatic decisions, shipping core foundations, and setting us up to scale.

1) Architecture & security hardening (first 4–8 weeks)

Review current platform architecture for scalability, maintainability and reliability

Identify and mitigate priority security risks (auth, tenancy/data isolation, API security, secrets management, audit/logging)

Produce and execute a practical roadmap for improvement (12–18 month horizon, MVP-first)

2) Build core product integrations (our MCP foundation)

Own end-to-end integrations including OAuth, sync logic, rate limits, retries, observability and data modelling:

Google Workspace: Gmail, Calendar, Drive

Microsoft 365: Outlook, Calendar, OneDrive

Xero: invoices, contacts, cashflow basics

3) Evolve the core platform

Strengthen backend services and APIs (Java) and work closely with the AI orchestration layer (Python with LangChain/LangGraph)

Improve data pipelines that feed our agents and enable reliable automation

Establish pragmatic engineering practices (CI/CD, test strategy, release hygiene, monitoring)

Our stack

Cloud: AWS (Australia region)

Backend: Java

Frontend: React Native

AI Orchestration: Python, LangChain, LangGraph

LLM integrations: OpenAI API, Google Vertex AI, Groq, AWS Bedrock

What we're looking for
Must-haves

Strong senior experience building and shipping backend/platform systems (ideally Java)

Ideally 7-8 years of experience in backend/platform systems development

Proven experience integrating with third-party SaaS APIs and managing OAuth flows in production

Practical cloud security mindset (AWS, IAM, auth patterns, API security, data isolation/tenancy)

Comfortable collaborating across Java + Python systems

High ownership: you don't just identify problems—you ship fixes

Australian work rights will be considered on a case-by-case basis for this remote/hybrid position.

Nice-to-haves

Experience with SMEs, vertical SaaS, or workflow automation products

Familiarity with agentic AI patterns, LLM tooling, or ML-adjacent product development

Exposure to compliance/security baselines (SOC2-style controls, even if informal)

Why join

Real product, real users, real mission (SMEs are under-served and drowning in admin)

Fully funded with runway to build properly (not ""week-to-week survival"")

Meaningful equity and the chance to shape the technical direction from here

Work on a modern AI stack with practical constraints (security, reliability, integrations)

About the compensation (transparent)

This role is not Big Tech cash. We're offering a below-market salary balanced by meaningful equity because we're optimising for long-term upside and impact. We'll share the band and equity range with candidates who reach first interview, and we're happy to discuss structuring (e.g., contract-to-perm, milestone-based increases).
