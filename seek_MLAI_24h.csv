We're looking for a versatile and resourceful Junior Machine Learning Engineer to join our small, hands-on team. You'll tackle a range of challenges involving unique industrial sensor data, with a primary focus on the deep learning models that power our defect detection.

This is a role for a true problem-solver. You won't just be tuning hyperparameters in a vacuum; you'll be responsible for the entire ML lifecycle—from designing data pipelines and training architectures for 3D segmentation to optimising models for the edge and integrating them into production code. This is a role for a builder; you'll be shipping solutions in a fast-moving environment where your work makes a tangible impact on physical manufacturing.

A Note On Our Culture: Is This Role For You?

We are a team of fast builders and tinkerers who thrive on rapid iteration and tangible results. We believe in moving quickly, learning from the results, and continuously improving.

To succeed in this role, you will need to learn quickly and adapt as you go. If you prefer a slower, more guided work environment, or if your passion lies more in theoretical research than in hands-on building and deployment, this might not be the role for you. We are looking for people who are driven by the process of creating, deploying, and seeing their solutions used in the real world.

What You'll Do

Design & Deploy: Train and refine deep learning models for classification and segmentation of unique sensor data.

ML Frameworks: Support the development of our ML framework, specifically focusing on image and 3D data.

Experiment at the Edge: Design and run experiments to push the performance of ML models on real-world hardware.

End-to-End Ownership: Learn and participate in the entire ML lifecycle, from data pre-processing through to model evaluation.

Collaborate: Work closely with our software engineering team to integrate models into our production software stack.

What You'll Bring

A Builder's Mindset: A genuine passion for machine learning and a strong desire to see your models solve real-world problems.

Technical Foundation: Solid knowledge of machine learning concepts, demonstrated through projects.

Deep Learning Tools: Hands on experience with frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow.

Python Proficiency: Strong familiarity with Python and its data science ecosystem (e.g., NumPy, Pandas).

Right to Work: You must have the right to work in Australia.

Bonus Points: Exposure to 3D data processing, computer vision, and software engineering practices (Git, Docker, Linux) is highly regarded.

What We Offer

Salary: Annual salary of $75,000 - $90,000 + super (pro-rata for part-time).

Invest in Your Growth: We provide dedicated, paid time for guided and self-directed learning to help you build a world-class foundation in ML.

Meaningful Equity: Through our employee share scheme, you'll have a real stake in our success.

The Mission: The opportunity to work on cutting-edge technology that is actively shaping the future of global manufacturing.

Collaborative Environment: A dynamic and flexible work environment at our Oakleigh office.

Ready to Join Us?

If you're a junior ML enthusiast who loves solving problems and wants to make a significant impact in a growing company, we would love to hear from you. Apply now to be part of our journey to revolutionise manufacturing!
