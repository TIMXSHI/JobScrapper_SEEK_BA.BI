About the Role

We’re looking for an AI Automation Specialist to help design and build intelligent automations that remove manual work, connect systems, and scale how our business operates.

This role sits at the intersection of automation, AI, and operations. You’ll work with modern automation tools and AI models to create workflows and agents that support real business outcomes - not experiments or demos.

You don’t need to be wedded to one platform. What matters is your ability to understand a problem, design a system, and automate it reliably.

⸻

What You’ll Do

    •    Identify manual or repetitive processes and turn them into smart automations

    •    Design and build workflows using tools such as:

    •    n8n, Make, Zapier, or similar

    •    Custom scripts or lightweight services where needed

    •    Build and integrate AI-powered workflows and agents, including:

    •    Content processing and transformation

    •    Decision-making and routing

    •    Data enrichment and validation

    •    Connect and integrate systems via APIs, webhooks, and third-party platforms

    •    Ensure automations are production-ready, with proper error handling, logging, and documentation

    •    Continuously improve existing workflows as the business scales

    •    Collaborate with leadership and teams to prioritise and deliver high-impact automation

⸻

What We’re Looking For

Essential

    •    Experience building automation workflows in real-world environments

    •    Comfortable working across multiple tools and platforms

    •    Strong understanding of APIs, data flows, and system integration

    •    Exposure to AI tools and large language models (LLMs)

    •    Logical, structured thinker who enjoys solving operational problems

    •    Able to work independently and own solutions end-to-end

Nice to Have

    •    Experience with AI agents or LLM orchestration

    •    Light coding experience (JavaScript, Python, or similar)

    •    Experience with no-code / low-code automation platforms

    •    Background in operations, product, or technical consulting

⸻

What Success Looks Like

    •    Manual processes are automated and no longer bottlenecks

    •    Systems talk to each other cleanly and reliably

    •    AI is used thoughtfully to augment workflows (not as a gimmick)

    •    Teams save time and trust the automations you’ve built

    •    Clear documentation means systems are easy to maintain and evolve

⸻

Why Join Us

    •    Work on meaningful, real-world automation problems

    •    Direct access to decision-makers and fast iteration

    •    Freedom to choose the right tools for the job

    •    Opportunity to shape how AI and automation are used across the business

    •    Flexible working arrangements

⸻

How to Apply

Please include:

    •    A brief overview of your automation experience

    •    Examples of workflows, automations, or systems you’ve built (links, screenshots, or descriptions)

    •    Any experience working with AI-driven workflows or agents"

We are an established systems integration contractor offering industrial automation and consulting services across a wide variety of industries.

Our mission is to help local manufacturing and processing businesses to be as successful as they possibly can be through skillful application of the latest control system technologies. Our customers include large well-known brands, as well as emerging businesses bringing exciting new products to the market.

Clients throughout Australia have been so thrilled with our practical and innovative approach to automating their processes and boosting their efficiency that demand for our services is at an all-time high. We therefore need to expand our incredible team of technology innovators with more skilled individuals who are seeking to make a real difference.

About the Role

We are looking for versatile engineers with real-world experience in machine control systems, especially industrial software platforms like Siemens, Rockwell, Phoenix and others.

The role has a fantastic amount of variety both in the technologies you'll deal with and the applications you'll encounter. Our wide cross-section of customers will provide you with opportunity to learn about many different industrial manufacturing processes for everything from food and beverage to steel tube forming, timber milling to concrete batching, textile weaving to material packaging, standalone machines to entire lines.

You will play a vital role across all stages of the job lifecycle. A typical week will consist of a mix of project work (typically 1-3 projects running concurrently), an occasional spot of troubleshooting for a breakdown at a customer site, some time assisting other team members, and always honing your skills through regular professional development and learning.

On average approximately half of your time will be spent in the office on system design and program preparation, and half out on sites commissioning and tuning your systems. Some working-from-home is available, and a small amount of regional and interstate travel is involved from time to time.

Supported by great colleagues you will carry out tasks such as:

Scoping and investigating requirements for new projects,

Advising and guiding customers in their choice of technologies and system architectures.

Designing, developing and commissioning PLC code and HMI interfaces

Programming inverters for induction motors and servo drive motion controls

Creating execution sequences for pneumatic and hydraulic actuators

Installing and configuring all manner of instrumentation sensors

Implementing safety access controls and interlocks

Industrial networking (both TCP/IP and serial-based field buses)

Planning and monitoring project phases

Mentoring less experienced staff

Providing advice to installation teams,

Troubleshooting and problem solving.

About the Person

You will have an engineering or programming degree, and at least 3 years working in industry, with hands-on experience programming PLCs, HMIs, servos drives and related devices to successfully automate production processes. You will also have exceptional verbal and written English communication skills which are crucial to this role where you will be interacting with a wide variety of people from production managers to factory line workers.

Candidates must be Australian citizens or permanent residents.

Maybe you've had a series of contracts and are now looking for a permanent role with more responsibility. Perhaps you've been supporting one particular business or line and are now yearning for some more variety. Or maybe you're already a seasoned automation professional looking for your next challenge.

Whatever your journey, we'd love you to take the next step here at Integrelec.

If this sounds like the role for you, then please submit your resume, and it will be advantageous to also call our office on (07) 3123 9538 to introduce yourself."
