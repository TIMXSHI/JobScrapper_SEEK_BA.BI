About the Group/Team

This year, the Learning Experience group's mission is to ignite creativity in every learner by being fun and accessible, saving teachers and course creators time, and looking after every learner, whether in school, on campus, or in the workplace. We want to continue evolving Canva into a best-in-class learning tool, so that we have a sticky product with better retention.

In 2026, our Engaging Learning team is making it dramatically easier for teachers to save time through two core capabilities: discovering curriculum-aligned content that's ready to use in the classroom, and AI workflows tailored to their specific teaching tasks. We're building discovery systems that surface the right content for each teacher's curriculum context, and generation capabilities that understand educational standards while integrating seamlessly into their existing workflows.

About the Role/Specialty

We’re the Learning Experience group within Teams and Education, on a mission to ignite creativity in every learner. We’re building seamless learning pathways for users of all kinds—students, teachers, teams—across the globe.

You’ll contribute to shared ML infrastructure and best practices at Canva

You’ll keep up with state-of-the-art developments and explore ways to apply them at scale

What we're looking for

You're a highly skilled machine learning engineer with a proven track record of delivering ML-powered product features in production. You bring deep technical expertise across the ML lifecycle—from data wrangling and model development to evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. You're comfortable operating independently while collaborating deeply with cross-functional teams, and you're motivated by user impact and product outcomes.

Demonstrated experience building and deploying ML-powered features in production environments

Proficiency with Python and frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch

Skilled across the ML lifecycle: data processing, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring

Proven ability to work independently while collaborating cross-functionally with product, design, and data

Experience with Generative AI (GenAI): LLMs, diffusion models, prompt engineering, RAG, or fine-tuning

Familiarity with GenAI platforms (e.g. OpenAI, Hugging Face, Anthropic) and embedding-based systems

Strong product mindset – prioritises ML solutions that improve user experience and product outcomes

Committed to scalable, maintainable ML systems with clear metrics and impact tracking

About the Group/Team

Canva Research – Design Generation

We’re building the systems that turn imagination into reality. Within Canva Research, the Design Generation group focuses on creating AI models and pipelines that produce beautiful designs for Canvas users. We work at the intersection of research and product, partnering closely with Product, Design, and Engineering to ship AI-powered experiences that feel magical, reliable, and deeply human. Our work directly shapes how users create, explore, and express ideas in Canva every day.

About the Role/Specialty:

As a Senior Research Engineer, we sit at the boundary between research and production. We explore new ideas in generative modelling, evaluate their real-world impact, and turn promising research into scalable systems that power Canva’s design experiences. As a Senior Research Engineer, this role operates with a high degree of autonomy, solving complex problems, influencing technical direction, and collaborating across teams to deliver meaningful outcomes. Our success is measured not just by research quality, but by the impact our work has on real users.

What you’ll do (responsibilities):

You’ll design, experiment with, and evaluate generative AI models for design-focused use cases.

You’ll translate research outcomes into scalable, production-ready systems.

You’ll collaborate closely with Product, Design, and Engineering partners to align research with user needs.

You’ll analyse model performance using both quantitative metrics and qualitative user signals.

You’ll contribute to technical discussions, architecture decisions, and long-term AI strategy.

You’ll share learnings through documentation, reviews, and internal presentations to uplift the broader team.

What we're looking for:


You’re an accomplished applied researcher who loves seeing ideas land in the hands of real users. You’re comfortable navigating ambiguity, balancing research depth with practical constraints, and making thoughtful trade-offs. You bring solid experience in machine learning or generative modelling, enjoy collaborating across disciplines, and care deeply about quality, ethics, and impact. You’re motivated by solving meaningful problems at scale and excited by the challenge of building AI that empowers creativity.

Bachelor or Masters degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or a related field, or equivalent skills gained through 3-5 years of work experience. Advanced qualifications including a PhD are an advantage.

Experience with generative models: Proficient in working with large language models (LLMs), diffusion models, and multimodal architectures to develop innovative solutions.

Skills in training generative models: Experienced in techniques such as fine-tuning, in-context learning, and reinforcement learning to optimise model performance.

Proficiency in deep learning frameworks: Skilled in leveraging tools like PyTorch, JAX, and HuggingFace for advanced research and experimentation.

Expertise in experimental design and evaluation: Capable of implementing experimental design strategies for generative models, using both quantitative metrics and qualitative analysis to assess outcomes.

Ability to enhance research tooling and workflows: Experienced in rapid prototyping, conducting ablation studies, and tracking experiments to streamline research processes.

Competence in data curation and analysis: Adept at managing and analysing datasets for training and evaluating generative systems.

Familiarity with current research literature: Skilled at reproducing impactful papers and applying novel techniques to address emerging problem spaces.
