We're partnering with a leading financial services organisation to find a technically strong Senior Data Scientist to join their analytics function.

What We're Looking For:

You're a Data Scientist who excels at productionising models and deploying robust, scalable solutions. Your strength lies in taking NLP and LLM projects from experimentation through to production, with deep technical expertise and strong engineering fundamentals. You're pragmatic, outcomes-focused, and thrive in technical environments where quality code and reliable deployments matter.

The Technical Essentials:

Education: Master's or PhD in Data Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science or related discipline
Production Focus: Proven track record of productionising data science solutions in commercial environments
NLP Expertise: Hands-on commercial experience with modern NLP techniques-supervised learning using LSTM/CNN/Transformers, topic modelling, and production implementations
LLM & GenAI: Real-world experience deploying GPT-based solutions (langchain, llamaindex, RAG pipelines, multi-agent frameworks)
Technical Chops: Advanced SQL proficiency and strong Python development capabilities, particularly in NLP contexts
Engineering Fundamentals: Experience building, deploying, and maintaining models in production environments
Research-Minded: You stay current with the latest LLM research and can apply it practically

What Makes You Stand Out:

You're technically sharp with a strong engineering mindset. You understand the full model lifecycle and can write production-quality code. You communicate clearly enough to collaborate effectively within technical teams, are open to feedback, and comfortable operating in agile, fast-paced environments."
