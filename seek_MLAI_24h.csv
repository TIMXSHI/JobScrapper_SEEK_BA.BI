About the job


As a Field Solutions Architect at Google Cloud, you are an embedded builder who bridges the gap between frontier AI products and production-grade reality within customers. Unlike traditional advisory roles, you function as a 'builder-consultant', moving beyond high-level architecture to code, debug, and jointly ship bespoke agentic solutions directly within the customer’s environment.

This role is designed for high-agency engineers with a founder’s mindset. You will work on blocker to production including solving the integration complexities, data readiness issues, and state-management challenges that prevent AI from reaching enterprise-grade maturity. By embedding with strategic accounts, you serve a dual purpose: providing 'white glove' deployment of complex AI systems and acting as a critical feedback loop, and transforming real-world field insights into Google Cloud’s future product roadmap.

Google Cloud accelerates every organization’s ability to digitally transform its business and industry. We deliver enterprise-grade solutions that leverage Google’s cutting-edge technology, and tools that help developers build more sustainably. Customers in more than 200 countries and territories turn to Google Cloud as their trusted partner to enable growth and solve their most critical business problems.

Responsibilities

Serve as the lead developer for complex AI applications, transitioning from rapid prototypes to production-grade agentic workflows (e.g., multi-agent systems, MCP servers) that drive measurable ROI.
Architect and code the connection between Google’s AI products and customer's live infrastructure, including APIs, legacy data silos, and security perimeters.
Build high-performance evaluation pipelines and observability frameworks to ensure agentic systems meet rigorous requirements for accuracy, safety, and latency.
Identify repeatable field patterns and technical 'friction points' in Google’s AI stack, converting them into reusable modules or formal product feature requests for the engineering teams.
Drive engineering excellence across the JAPAC region by mentoring talent, co-building with customer teams to instill best practices, and influencing cross-functional strategies to uplevel organizational technical capabilities.
Google is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.

What you’d be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

As a Senior Threat Detection Engineer, you will be a technical expert delivering high-impact security engineering solutions across our detection and platform engineering service streams. You will design and implement enterprise-grade detection capabilities, automate security workflows, and enhance our security platform infrastructure. Your work will directly strengthen Canva's security posture by enabling faster threat detection, reducing analyst toil through automation, and scaling our security operations capabilities.

This role requires balancing security effectiveness with operational efficiency. You will leverage automation, infrastructure-as-code, and cloud-native technologies to deliver scalable, resilient security solutions while maintaining the operational excellence of production security systems.We are not looking for someone who checks every single box, we’re looking for lifelong learners and people who can make us better with their unique experiences.

Lead detection engineering initiatives end-to-end, from threat research and design documentation through implementation, testing, and production deployment, developing high-fidelity detection logic covering threat vectors of interest to Canva.
Participate in rotations and on-call schedules to support incident response and alert triage activities.
Partner with Application Security, CTI, and Red Team to conduct threat modelling, translate threat intelligence into actionable detections, and validate detection effectiveness through threat simulation scenarios.
Implement detection-as-code practices using version control, CI/CD pipelines, and automated testing frameworks to enable scalable, version-controlled detection deployment.
Design and build sophisticated SOAR workflows that automate detection triage, investigation, and response activities, developing custom integrations with security tools and cloud platforms.
Create automation and enrichment pipelines that reduce manual context-switching and cognitive load for analysts, improving mean-time-to-detect, analyse, and respond to security events.
Architect and maintain security platform infrastructure supporting detection, investigation, and response capabilities using infrastructure-as-code (Terraform/Ansible) and establish service-level objectives for platform services.
Establish monitoring and alerting for platform health, detection coverage, and operational metrics to ensure reliability and visibility.
Collaborate across security and engineering teams including D&R Operations, DFIR, Application Security, and cloud infrastructure teams to define and integrate telemetry requirements, deploy security sensors, and ensure comprehensive visibility.
Provide technical consultation and mentorship, advising stakeholders on detection strategy, automation capabilities, and platform limitations while developing junior engineers in detection engineering and platform operations.

You're probably a match if you have

5+ years of hands-on experience in security engineering, threat hunting, detection engineering, or security operations (SOC), with proven ability to design and implement detection capabilities at scale.
Experience in SOC and alert triage.
Proven track record in threat hunting or designing, implementing, and tuning detection logic for enterprise security platforms (SIEM, EDR, SOAR).
Experience with detection engineering lifecycle: threat research, detection development (KQL, SPL, ESQL, SQL-style languages), testing, deployment, tuning, and lifecycle management.
Proficient in at least one programming language (Python or Go preferred) for automation development and custom tool creation.
Hands-on experience with enterprise security platforms including: SIEM platforms (Elastic Security, Splunk, or similar), EDR solutions (SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender, or similar), SOAR platforms (Tines, Splunk SOAR, Cortex XSOAR, or similar).
Experience building SOAR workflows or automation playbooks (with or without code).
Infrastructure-as-code experience using Terraform/Ansible or similar tools to deploy and manage security infrastructure.
Hands-on experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
Understanding of CI/CD pipelines and DevOps practices applied to security engineering workflows.
Understanding of containerisation, Kubernetes, and cloud-native application architectures from a security perspective.
Knowledge of networking concepts, protocols, and security controls relevant to detection and monitoring.

Beneficial Experience (not required, but helpful)

Background in Threat Hunting, Threat Intelligence, DFIR.
Experience with advanced detection techniques: behavioural analytics, anomaly detection, machine learning-based detection and GenAI workflows.
Knowledge of big data analytic platforms and query optimisation.
Prior experience building or operating Detection Engineering programs or Security Operations Centres.
Contributing to open-source security tools or publishing detection engineering research.

About the team

The Detection & Response (D&R) organisation is responsible for protecting Canva from security threats through proactive detection engineering, incident response, and security platform operations.
