Background in Siemens, Rockwell/Allen-Bradley, Schneider or similar PLC platforms

Comfortable working in a structured, quality-driven engineering environment

Clear communicator with a methodical approach to problem-solving

NICE TO HAVE

Exposure to C#, Python or Java (tools, diagnostics, IPC-based logic)
