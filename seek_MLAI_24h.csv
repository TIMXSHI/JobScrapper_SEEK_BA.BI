As a Level 3 Support Engineer (or a strong Level 2 ready to step up), you’ll deliver advanced technical support and high-impact project work for clients in the Architecture and Design sector. You’ll work closely with Digital/BIM Managers and Directors, leading upgrades, specialist projects, and — most excitingly — AI system deployments and integrations.
Over time, you’ll become the trusted advisor for your client portfolio, helping them modernise their environment, optimise their BIM tools, and adopt AI solutions that make their teams faster, smarter, and more efficient.

Responsibilities
• Resolve complex technical issues escalated from L1 and L2 through phone, email, and ticketing
• Configure, deploy, and maintain servers and network infrastructure to ensure performance and security
• Design, deploy, and maintain AI-enabled systems such as Microsoft Copilot, M365 AI tools, and custom internal AI chat systems
• Work with internal specialists to deliver tailored IT and AI solutions
• Troubleshoot network, hardware, and software issues with a structured, analytical approach
• Lead project deployments, including upgrades, migrations, and AI rollout initiatives
• Create and maintain documentation, including AI integration guides and best practices
• Ensure SLAs are met and deliver consistently high-quality support
• Keep up to date with emerging tech, especially in AI, automation, and Microsoft platforms

About You
You love technology, solving problems, and taking ownership. You’re ready for a role with deeper client engagement, bigger challenges, and the chance to work on projects that genuinely shape how businesses operate.
You’re especially excited about where tech is headed — AI, automation, smarter systems — and you want to be part of that future rather than watch from the sidelines.

Ideally you have:
• 3+ years’ experience as a Level 2 or 3 Support Engineer in an MSP/IT services environment
• Strong skills across Microsoft 365, Azure, and modern AI tools within the M365 ecosystem
• Experience or interest in secure AI systems, automation workflows, or internal AI chat tools
• Excellent communication and client-facing abilities
• Solid networking knowledge (TCP/IP, VLANs, VPNs, routing)
• Virtualisation: VMware or Hyper-V
• Proven ability to deploy and maintain server and cloud environments
• A proactive mindset and a genuine love for learning
