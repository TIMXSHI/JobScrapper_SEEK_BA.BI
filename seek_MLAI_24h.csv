Employment Status: Permanent / Contractor

Background
We’re proud to partner with a leading global organisation that’s driving data innovation across infrastructure, utilities, energy, and telecommunications. Backed by extensive enterprise-scale operations and a shared commitment to sustainability and digital transformation, our partners are delivering projects that reshape how critical systems operate around the world.
Eighteen months ago, this organisation expanded into Melbourne, recognising the city’s importance in Australia’s energy transition. Since then, they’ve partnered with some of the most forward-thinking utility providers in the Asia Pacific, working on large-scale modernisation initiatives that use data engineering and machine learning to solve real-world infrastructure challenges. With demand growing and technical scope expanding, they’re building out their local data team to take this work even further.

Why Join
As part of this high-performing data and engineering team, you’ll work on technically ambitious use cases across utilities, energy, and infrastructure transformation. The team partners with leaders in the field to apply cutting-edge technologies such as Databricks, Microsoft Fabric, and Azure-native tools to deliver production-grade data systems that enable predictive maintenance, optimisation, and smarter decision-making.
This is an opportunity to shape data-driven solutions that have measurable impact, from reducing network outages to improving the reliability of essential services. You'll be joining a group of curious, capable peers who value experimentation, solid engineering principles, and delivering meaningful outcomes at scale.

How We’re Making an Impact
In one recent engagement, the team helped a major electricity distributor predict which transformers were most at risk of overload. By combining telemetry data, geospatial context, and consumption patterns, they created a scalable model that guided maintenance decisions and reduced infrastructure costs by millions. It’s the kind of work that shows how purposeful data engineering can change how society’s most critical systems operate.

Role Overview
Build and maintain scalable data pipelines using Spark and Microsoft Fabric to support analytics, reporting, and machine learning products.
Collaborate with leading utility providers in electricity, gas, and water to solve operational challenges.
Leverage tools such as Databricks, machine learning, and generative AI (like autonomous agents) to design and deliver innovative data-driven solutions.
Key Responsibilities
Develop and operate cloud-based data pipelines that support analytical products and predictive insights.
Apply DevOps practices across CI/CD, automated testing, version control, and release automation.
Contribute to solution design, collaborating cross-functionally to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability.
