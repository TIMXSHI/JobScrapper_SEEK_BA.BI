Take pride in having a meaningful impact on regional, rural and remote communities while being a pivotal player in the energy industry's future.

About the role

In this role, you'll be responsible for the development, maintenance and ongoing improvement of electric network models, ensuring they remain accurate and fit for purpose. You'll manage a single source of truth for network models and contribute to technical studies and innovative solutions that support evolving network and customer needs. This role has a strong emphasis on data analytics and automation and require proficiency in Python scripting, SQL, and data management fundamentals at a level comparable to a Databricks Data Analyst. The engineer will leverage these skills within Databricks to improve data quality and deliver insights, while continuing to ensure a single source of truth for network model data.

You'll work closely with internal stakeholders, engineers and external partners to deliver modelling services, support planning decisions, and improve network performance across high, medium and low voltage networks.

This is a temporary role for 12 months can be based anywhere within Essential Energy's operational footprint.

You will be responsible for:


Develop, curate, and enhance electric network models using advanced data techniques.
Automate data extraction and transformation processes using Python and SQL to ensure models are built on clean, accurate data.

Provide modelling and technical analysis to support planning, operational and project requirements.
Improve network model data related to load flows and short circuit studies.
Collate and analyse network and historical data to prepare technical models, case studies and recommendations.
Support load flow and short circuit modelling across distribution and sub-transmission networks.
Implement rigorous data quality checks and validation steps. Ensure that network model datasets meet required standards and are aligned with industry formats (for example, CIM or RAWX) for consistency and interoperability.
Work closely with network planning engineers and data teams to integrate new data sources and analytics methods.
Contribute to innovative solutions that improve how network modelling data is managed, analysed, and utilized across the business, always focusing on data-driven decision-making.
Build and maintain strong relationships with internal teams, stakeholders, regulators and customers.
Actively promote behaviours that support safety, integrity, inclusion and high ethical standards.

About You

You're an electrical engineer with a strong background in power system modelling and analysis, as well as strong python programming and SQL skills. Background in power systems or network modelling (e.g. load flow, protection, or energy network analysis) is expected. Ability to blend domain expertise with programming skills to solve electrical network modelling problems efficiently. Hands-on experience with data analysis or engineering in a Databricks (or similar big-data) environment is desirable, demonstrating ability to manipulate large datasets and implement analytics workflows. You enjoy solving complex technical problems, working collaboratively, and contributing to meaningful outcomes that benefit regional communities.

You will bring:

Experience using power system modelling tools for technical studies (such as load flow, short‑circuit analysis and dynamic simulations).
Knowledge of network design standards, regulatory requirements and industry guidelines.
Experience developing and managing models using industry‑recognised modelling software.
Strong python programming and SQL skills.
Strong analytical, problem‑solving and report‑writing skills.
Well‑developed communication skills and the ability to work effectively with a range of stakeholders.

About the job


Like Google's own ambitions, the work of a Software Engineer goes beyond just Search. Software Engineering Managers have not only the technical expertise to take on and provide technical leadership to major projects, but also manage a team of Engineers. You not only optimize your own code but make sure Engineers are able to optimize theirs. As a Software Engineering Manager you manage your project goals, contribute to product strategy and help develop your team. Teams work all across the company, in areas such as information retrieval, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking, security, data compression, user interface design; the list goes on and is growing every day. Operating with scale and speed, our exceptional software engineers are just getting started -- and as a manager, you guide the way.

With technical and leadership expertise, you manage engineers across multiple teams and locations, a large product budget and oversee the deployment of large-scale projects across multiple sites internationally.
