MotorPlatform is Australia’s fastest-growing B2B automotive marketplace and SaaS platform.

The core platform is built. The next phase is the hard, high-leverage work: scaling product, scaling engineering, and scaling operational excellence, while we shift to being AI-first in how we build and how the platform creates value.

The role

We’re hiring a Senior Full-Stack Engineer to act as Deputy Lead / 2IC in engineering. You’ll be a hands-on builder who can take ownership of major initiatives, lead projects end-to-end, and keep delivery moving with clarity and discipline.

Onsite in Sydney. We want fast feedback loops, high collaboration, and strong product-engineering alignment.

What you’ll be doing (this is a scale role, not a “greenfield” role)

You’ll work on the problems that show up when something is already working and growing fast:

Scale system performance, reliability, and developer velocity as usage expands

Harden security, privacy, observability, and operational runbooks

Build new marketplace capabilities that unlock liquidity, speed, and better dealer outcomes

Reduce friction in critical workflows and improve conversion through product-led engineering

Lead projects that cut across web, mobile, backend, and infrastructure

Improve delivery predictability through planning, coordination, and proactive risk management

Mentor engineers and set the bar for pragmatic, high-quality execution

AI-first: what we expect from you

We’re becoming an AI-first business. That means AI isn’t an experiment on the side—it’s part of the operating system.

You’ll help embed AI into:

Product: smarter workflows, better matching, better quality control, dealer-facing efficiency

Operations: internal tools, automation, knowledge capture, faster support and triage

Engineering: AI-assisted development, testing acceleration, improved reviews, quicker iteration

You’ll partner with our AI/BI team to embed intelligence into the platform and marketplace, including:

Integrating valuation engines into core workflows (pricing, buying, selling, approvals)

Shipping analytics and insights (vehicle acquisition and disposal performance, liquidity signals, margin drivers)

Productionising data/AI services: API contracts, monitoring, quality checks, fallbacks, latency and cost controls

Building internal tools for faster decisions (dashboards, alerts, workflow automation)

You don’t need an ML background. You do need to be comfortable shipping AI-enabled features responsibly and using AI to increase leverage.

Tech stack

Web: React

Mobile: React Native

Backend: PHP (Laravel & Vapor) + Node/TypeScript where it fits

Database: Postgres

Cloud: AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda)

Delivery: CI/CD, testing, modern development practices

What we’re looking for

Must-haves

Min 6+ years full-stack engineering experience in production

Strong PHP/Laravel (non-negotiable)

Strong React; React Native strongly valued

Strong Postgres fundamentals (schema, migrations, optimisation)

AWS experience (EC2/RDS/S3/Lambda)

Track record leading delivery end-to-end and operating as a senior owner

Highly organised, proactive, and quick to absorb product + industry context

Wants to work onsite in Sydney (Lane Cove)

Nice-to-haves

Marketplace / high-growth SaaS scaling experience

AI-enabled feature delivery (LLM APIs, retrieval/search, automation)

IaC (Terraform/CloudFormation)

Testing frameworks (PHPUnit/Pest, Jest/Mocha)

Why this is a strong next step

The platform is real and growing and your work immediately compounds

You’ll have leadership scope without being removed from building

You’ll help shape how we scale and how we embed AI into the business

You’ll work closely with Product and influence what gets built and why
