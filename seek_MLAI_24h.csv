Advise, help build, and orchestrate data pipelines that unify fragmented workplace data (surveys, goals, performance reviews, feedback, 1-1 notes) into coherent coaching context
Translate customer requirements into technical solutions - working backwards from user needs to system design. Creating technical documentation to support literacy, technical transfer and engineering practice.
Partner closely with product, design, and people science to ensure the features developed are fit for purpose, and in-line with the existing product expectations to ensure seamless partnership transfer of technology.
