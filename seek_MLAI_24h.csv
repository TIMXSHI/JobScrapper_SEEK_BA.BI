Nearmap is the Australian-founded, global tech pioneer innovating in location intelligence. Customers rely on Nearmap for consistent, reliable, high-resolution imagery, insights, and answers to create meaningful change in the world and propel industries forward. Harnessing its own patented camera systems, imagery capture, AI, geospatial tools, and advanced SaaS platforms, Nearmap stands as the definitive source of truth that shapes the liveable world.

Job Description


We are recruiting a hands-on Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for R&D and strong expertise in applying deep learning techniques to practical computer vision applications. You will work with an incredibly passionate and talented team of Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers, and your work will have a real impact on Nearmap products. You will train novel deep learning models that leverage our rich data sets, multiple dates of high-resolution imagery, multi-angle source imagery and 3D textured mesh. You will collaborate closely with other team members to solve various 2D and 3D vision tasks by selecting the model architecture, designing training and evaluation methodologies, generating a suitable dataset, and optimising models for deployment. The released models will run on millions of square kilometres of Nearmap imagery.

Experience in applying deep learning techniques to commercial use cases and non-academic problems is highly valued. We are committed to software best practices including infrastructure as code, GitOps, CI/CD, and as much automation as makes sense. A strong background in 3D modelling is advantageous in this role.

Key Responsibilities

Design and scope greenfield machine learning projects in collaboration with the team
Develop and deliver end-to-end solutions to complex technical problems
Train and optimize deep learning models using our extensive multi-temporal, multi-angle, and 3D imagery datasets
Participate in technical discussions, code reviews, and knowledge sharing sessions

Qualifications


Mandatory Skills

Programming/Tech Environments: Ability to code in scientific Python, using a Linux environment, and Git for source control
Machine Learning: Strong grasp of machine learning fundamentals (regularisation, hyperparameter optimisation, validation methods), and recent AI advancements
Scientific Approach: Follow the scientific method of formulating hypotheses, and applying statistical tests to validate them
Deep Learning: Applying modern artificial neural networks to solve machine learning problem
Tertiary Qualifications Formal education in a field related to computer science, machine learning, deep learning and AI.

Highly Desirable Skills

Domain Knowledge – Computer Vision: Working on Machine Learning problems applied to image data
Domain Knowledge – 3D Reconstruction: Experience with 3D computer vision, photogrammetry, structure-from-motion, or related technologies
Software Engineering: Working on shared codebases to produce production quality code
Cloud Computing: Working on AWS or GCP using distributed virtual machines, Docker containers, etc.
GP-GPU: Using GPUs to accelerate scientific computing
Scale: Working with large data sets, where data sets don't fit into memory, and require multiple nodes to compute efficiently

Personal Attributes

Pragmatism: While extensive knowledge of ML theory is highly valued, we prioritize pragmatic solutions that work over elaborate theory when shipping products
Collaboration: Data science is a team sport—communicate well, share knowledge, and be open to taking on ideas from anyone in the team
Attention to detail: Thoroughness in model development, testing, and documentation

This role is based in Sydney, Australia but also open to candidates from the east coast of Australia working remotely.
