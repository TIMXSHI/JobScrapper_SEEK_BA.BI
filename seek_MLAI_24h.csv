Working closely with data engineers, analysts, and business stakeholders, the Data Modeller ensures that data is well-organized, standardized, and aligned with governance and quality frameworks to enable efficient data-driven decision-making across the organization.

Flexible work is available including hybrid work from client’s site at Port Melbourne.

Your future duties and responsibilities:


• Contribute to the design, development, and continuous refinement of conceptual, logical, and physical data models within the Data Transformation team.
• Create and maintain SQL DDL scripts, along with detailed mapping and ETL documentation, to support Data Engineers in constructing and loading data models.
• When required, carry out reverse engineering of existing data models from databases or SQL code to ensure alignment with current architecture and standards.
• Develop and update business documentation, including process maps, taxonomies, and ontology diagrams, to provide clarity and traceability of data flows.
• Maintain a strong emphasis on conceptual and business data modelling, ensuring that structures align with organisational objectives.
• Interpret and translate business requirements into scalable data models that support long-term analytical and operational needs.
• Assist in managing and maintaining controlled vocabularies and the corporate data catalogue to promote consistency and reuse of data assets.
• Participate in modelling workshops and collaborative sessions with other Data Modellers to align on best practices and design approaches.
• Adhere to existing Data Quality and Data Governance frameworks, contributing to their ongoing enhancement and ensuring compliance with modelling standards.

• Sound understanding of data modelling methodologies, including Kimball, Inmon, Top-down/Bottom-up, Relational and Dimensional Modelling, Data Warehousing, and 3NF approaches.
• Ability to think conceptually and apply modelling techniques such as generalisation, subtyping, and super-typing to create efficient and flexible models.
• Skilled in producing Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) using a range of notations, such as Crow’s Foot and UML.
• Strong technical understanding of databases, ETL/ELT pipelines, and programming languages (typically SQL), with the ability to connect these technologies to data modelling practices. (This is a hands-on role involving active work with data.)
• Solid comprehension of business processes, with the ability to capture requirements accurately and translate them into effective technical designs.
• Confident communicator, capable of engaging in technical discussions with both technical and non-technical audiences across all organisational levels.
