Experience working with modern data technology (e.g. dbt, spark, containers, devops tooling, orchestration tools, git, etc.)

Deep expertise in cloud data platforms, AI/ML technologies (including LLMs, machine learning pipelines, and MLOps), data warehousing, and modern data architecture

Hands-on expertise with SQL, Python, and data modeling concepts, with ability to explain complex technical architectures in business terms

Exceptional presentation and communication skills specifically with C-level executives, including demonstrated ability to translate highly complex technical concepts into compelling business value propositions that drive executive decision-making

Proven experience working with product management teams to influence roadmaps, prioritize features, and drive customer-centric development through effective internal advocacy

Outstanding ability to conduct executive briefings, board presentations, and strategic planning sessions with senior leadership teams across technical and business functions

Strong track record of internal advocacy within technology companies, representing customer needs to product and engineering organizations while facilitating cross-functional collaboration

Experience in SaaS, consumer technology, or design/creative industries preferred, with understanding of business intelligence, analytics, and data-driven decision making

University degree in computer science, engineering, mathematics or related fields, or equivalent experience preferred. Masters in Data Science or Business Administration is a plus

Experience facilitating C-level strategic planning sessions focused on data and AI strategy would be beneficial but not required

About Our Team:


Our Principal Solution Engineers are customer obsessed and serve as the bridge between our most strategic customers and our internal product organization. We believe in the transformative power of executive relationships and technical advocacy. We love to learn, are open to giving and receiving feedback, and are passionate about making our clients successful while ensuring their voice shapes Snowflake's future. Our team works to ensure data is accessible, usable and valuable to everyone while driving product innovation through customer advocacy.


About Snowflake


Snowflake started with a clear vision: make modern data warehousing effective, affordable, and accessible to all data users. Because traditional on-premises and cloud solutions struggle with this, Snowflake developed an innovative product with a new built-for-the-cloud architecture that combines the power of data warehousing, the flexibility of big data platforms, and the elasticity of the cloud at a fraction of the cost of traditional solutions.

Snowflake is growing fast, and we’re scaling our team to help enable and accelerate our growth. We are looking for people who share our values, challenge ordinary thinking, and push the pace of innovation while building a future for themselves and Snowflake.
