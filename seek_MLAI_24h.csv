Qualifications

Deep technical and architectural expertise across human‑in‑the‑loop systems, autonomous agents and backend workflow automation, grounded in AI/ML, LLMs, agent frameworks (e.g., LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI) and cloud‑native design on AWS/GCP.

Proven ability to architect agentic systems balancing autonomy, explainability and human control, including context engineering, memory isolation, state management and event‑driven, modular patterns using vector databases and modern AI frameworks.

Hands‑on experience building and scaling AI platform capabilities (e.g., LLM gateways, MCP gateways/servers) and familiarity with interoperability standards/protocols such as MCP, A2A and AP2, or demonstrable ability to rapidly upskill.

Strong command of AI observability, monitoring and evaluation to ensure agent safety, transparency and performance, with practical tool and practice exposure.

Enterprise‑scale strategic advisory impact—shaping AI and agentic adoption, risk management, governance and investment decisions; influencing executives and senior stakeholders with clear, pragmatic recommendations.

Recognised leadership and influence—mentoring and upskilling engineers and architects, communicating complex AI concepts to technical and non‑technical audiences, and building communities of practice internally and across APAC.
