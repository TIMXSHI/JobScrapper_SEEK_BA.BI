About the role 

This role leads the research, development, deployment, and continuous enhancement of advanced Computer Vision, Perception AI, and Spatial Intelligence capabilities to improve operational efficiency, asset intelligence, safety, and automation across the electrical distribution network. Working with high-dimensional multi-modal data—including imagery, video, spatial datasets, and selected LiDAR/3D applications—the role delivers core perception technologies that enable a variety of digital and hardware initiatives. It is also responsible for establishing robust MLOps practices to ensure scalable model development, reliable deployment, ongoing monitoring, and continuous improvement. The role works collaboratively with other specialised teams across the organisation to ensure alignment, clear boundaries, and efficient integration of related capabilities. 

Key responsibilities 

Lead, coach, and develop a specialised team of computer vision, perception AI, and spatial AI engineers to deliver high-quality outcomes.

Create and maintain the Perception & Spatial AI Capability Roadmap, ensuring alignment with organisational priorities and complementary teams.

Own the full lifecycle of vision and perception models, including data management, training, validation, deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement.

Implement scalable MLOps pipelines for data ingestion, model versioning, CI/CD for ML, retraining, and operational monitoring.

Lead the design and development of advanced computer vision and perception AI models for detection, segmentation, anomaly identification, change detection, and scene understanding.

Build scalable perception algorithms using imagery, video, 3D spatial data, and multi-sensor inputs to support operational decision-making.

Collaborate with the Generative AI (agentic applications) team on multi-modal solutions where perception outputs integrate with LLMs, agents, or decision systems.

Employ generative AI techniques—such as synthetic data, diffusion models, or multi-modal fusion—to strengthen perception model performance.
