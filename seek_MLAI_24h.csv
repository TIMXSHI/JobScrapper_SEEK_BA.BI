At The Alpha School System (TASS), we believe every child deserves the chance to dream big and succeed, and that every great future begins with a great education. That's why we build technology that strengthens school operations, empowers educators, and unites communities, so together, we can lay the strongest foundations for tomorrow.

A Brisbane-based software company, TASS develops and supports school management and learning analytics systems, currently relied upon by hundreds of independent schools throughout Australia.

TASS is the market-leading provider of school management systems to Australian independent schools, and forms part of the Education vertical of the Volaris Group of companies, a subsidiary of Constellation Software Inc. (CSI). CSI is an equal opportunity employer of more than 50,000 employees worldwide with a consolidated turnover of USD 10 billion.

This represents a rare opportunity to have the stability and support of a strong global business and the autonomy to make a difference.

About the role

This role delivers high-quality software features using deeply embedded AI-first engineering practices. It is responsible for building, enhancing, and modernising product capabilities through structured, agentic AI-assisted development workflows, not ad-hoc AI usage.

Working within a focused AI pod, the position contributes to UI/UX modernisation, enterprise uplift, architectural improvement, and international localisation.

We’re looking for a developer who actively engineers with AI agents as part of their daily workflow, using CLI-based AI coding tools (e.g. Claude Code CLI, Kiro CLI, or equivalent) to orchestrate multi-step development tasks including feature build, refactoring, test generation, documentation, and investigation.

This is not a role for occasional AI use. AI must be deeply embedded in how you design, build, test, and improve software.

Key Responsibilities

Build and enhance platform functionality using AI-augmented and agent-orchestrated development workflows.

Use CLI-based AI coding agents to accelerate coding, refactoring, debugging, test generation, and documentation.

Design and execute multi-step AI workflows for feature delivery and legacy modernisation.

Deliver clean, secure, maintainable, and performant code aligned with engineering standards.

Implement modern UI/UX components and front-end improvements.

Contribute to the uplift of architectural components, backend systems, and enterprise-grade functionality.

Improve system performance, reliability, and scalability.

Adapt features for different regional requirements using AI-assisted content validation and logic variation.

Collaborate closely with the AI-First Product Lead to understand requirements and acceptance criteria.

Ensure quality through automated and AI-assisted testing approaches.

Participate in sprint planning, estimation, and continuous delivery practices.

Contribute to evolving AI-enabled engineering standards, patterns, and tooling across the business.

Essential Skills and Qualifications

5+ years’ experience as a software developer.

Solid experience with modern full-stack software development technologies.

Demonstrated use of AI coding agents within real development workflows.

Experience using CLI-based AI tools (e.g. Claude Code CLI, Kiro CLI, or similar) as part of day-to-day engineering.

Ability to orchestrate AI agents across multi-step development tasks rather than relying on single-prompt generation.

Strong understanding of engineering fundamentals and best-practice patterns.

Ability to critically evaluate AI-generated output and ensure production-grade quality.

Competence in debugging, refactoring, and implementing maintainable code.

Effective communication and documentation skills.

Preferred Skills

Experience working with legacy and/or enterprise applications.

Experience contributing to performance, reliability, or scalability improvements.

Experience designing repeatable AI workflows or internal development automation.

Exposure to architectural modernisation initiatives.

Proficiency in core languages and frameworks relevant to TASS (e.g. CFML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, .NET, SQL) or comparable technologies.

Attributes

High initiative and strong sense of ownership.

AI-enthusiastic and systematic in embedding AI into engineering workflows.

Comfortable working in CLI-based AI environments.

Strong attention to detail and commitment to code quality.

Collaborative, pragmatic, and customer-focused.

Comfortable in a fast-paced, iterative delivery environment.

Benefits of working with TASS

Join a leading brand in the education software space that is on an exciting growth journey.

Opportunity to shape and mature AI-first engineering capability within an established product.

Participation in our corporate bonus program.

Company-funded training and career development.

Regular social events in and out of office.

Flexible work hours and remote work options, though ideally based in the Brisbane region to attend the office as needed.

If you actively engineer with AI agents, and can demonstrate how AI materially improves your speed, quality, and technical outcomes, we would welcome your application."
