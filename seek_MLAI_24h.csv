About the Role

We're seeking an experienced Data Solution Designer for an initial six-month contract engagement. This position is ideal for someone passionate about data, eager to learn, and capable of translating business requirements into practical, scalable solutions. The primary focus will be on data modelling and SQL, which is absolutely critical for success in this role.



You'll wear different hats—sometimes analysing data, sometimes designing models, and sometimes defining how solutions will work end-to-end. The right mindset, curiosity, and ability to learn are just as important as technical skills.



Key Responsibilities
Understand existing data solutions and design enhancements on top of them.
Develop end-to-end data solutions, including how data flows, where it's stored, and how it's presented.
Design data models using Kimball and Data Lake techniques.

Work with cloud environments (AWS preferred) and modern data technologies.

What We're Looking For
Strong experience in data solution design or related roles.
Exceptional SQL skills (must-have), including advanced analytical functions.
Strong experience in data modelling and creating data marts.
Ability to analyse and interpret data effectively.
Exposure to cloud platforms (AWS ideal, others welcome).
Excellent communication skills to engage with business and technical teams.
Self-starter with strong initiative and investigative mindset.
Ability to wear multiple hats and adapt to changing priorities.

In this role, you'll be expected to quickly understand the existing solution and identify which hubs do what, then build on top of current designs while ensuring scalability and usability. Success will require strong problem-solving and analytical thinking—knowing where to start, what to do, and who to involve at each stage. If this sounds like you, we'd love to see your application come through!
