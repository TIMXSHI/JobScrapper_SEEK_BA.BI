Our client owns mission-critical systems, moves fast, and continuously delivers. Analyse, experiment, and optimise trading systems end-to-end to unlock performance advantages in ultra-low latency environments.

What You’ll Do:

You’ll push the limits of performance by analysing how complex trading systems interact with external exchanges. Through experimentation, data analysis, and creative problem-solving, you’ll uncover opportunities that deliver measurable competitive advantage.

Your Responsibilities Will Include:

Reverse-engineering system and exchange behaviour using black-box analysis

Designing statistical experiments to explain real-world performance phenomena

Analysing large-scale network and system data to identify optimisation paths

Building rapid prototypes to test new ideas, tools, and technologies

Partnering with traders, software, hardware, and infrastructure teams to implement improvements

Why Join Us:

This is a rare opportunity to work in one of the most technically demanding environments in the world. You’ll have the freedom to experiment, access to cutting-edge infrastructure, and the chance to see your ideas directly impact real-time trading performance.

About You:

You thrive on deep technical challenges and enjoy working close to the metal. You bring strong systems thinking, curiosity, and at least one area of deep expertise—whether in Linux internals, networking, low-latency hardware, or performance engineering. You’re data-driven, self-directed, and motivated by finding an edge.

If you’re excited by complex systems, real-time data, and the pursuit of extreme performance, this role puts you right at the heart of the action.
