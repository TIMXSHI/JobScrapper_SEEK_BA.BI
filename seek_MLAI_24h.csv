ABOUT VIVA LEISURE

At Viva Leisure, our mission is simple: to connect health and wellness to as many people as possible through our awesome, affordable, and accessible facilities. Our vision is to be the number one in the industry — benefitting our members, shareholders, franchisees, communities, and employees alike.

As an Australian-owned and ASX-listed company, we offer a diverse range of health and fitness solutions, including big-box health clubs, express gyms, high-intensity group training studios, Pilates, yoga, aquatics, women’s-only facilities, personal training, and more. Established in 2004, our key brands include Club Lime, hiit republic, Plus Fitness, GROUNDUP, and Rebalance. With over 300 facilities across Australia and internationally, including corporate-owned and franchised sites, we’re proud to serve diverse communities.

In 2020, Viva Leisure acquired Chain Collective Group to expand our fitness franchise brands both domestically and internationally. Chain Collective now operates as the franchising arm of Viva Leisure, proudly holding Plus Fitness as its flagship franchised brand — paving the way for the continued growth and success of multiple fitness concepts across Australia and beyond.

In 2024, Viva Leisure acquired a 34% stake in Boutique Fitness Studios (BFS), the master franchisee for leading global brands including Club Pilates, Rumble Boxing, StretchLab, and CycleBar. This partnership marks an exciting new chapter as Viva’s Rebalance Pilates & Yoga studios transition to Club Pilates, uniting local expertise with world-class brand standards to deliver a premium member experience. That same year, Viva Leisure also acquired a 25% equity stake in World Gym Australia, along with three corporate-owned World Gym locations in Queensland — Stafford, Coomera, and Underwood — further strengthening our presence in the premium fitness sector.
