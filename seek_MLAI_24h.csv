Familiarity with protocols and standards in the traffic and transport domain (SCATS, NEMA TS2, ITS, CAN, Ethernet, Modbus, RS-485).

Hands-on experience with real-time simulation, and fault injection for validation of safety systems.

Contribution to safety case documentation and engagement with external certification authorities/auditors.

Demonstrated ability to integrate embedded Linux (desirable) for communications/ UI while keeping safety functions isolated on RT cores/ MCUs.

Desirable:

Experience with traffic control algorithms, conflict detection, phase timing, and intergreen intervals.

Experience in secure boot, OTA update frameworks (RAUC/OSTree), and cybersecurity for embedded systems.

Exposure to Yocto/Buildroot, RTOS (Micrium, FreeRTOS), or dual-core MCU + Linux SoC designs.

Prior work in roadside, rail, transport systems or medical fields with harsh environment constraints.
