• Maintain RAG data freshness and ensure reconciliation of source-of-truth vs retrieval indexes; implement scheduled backfills and PII purges. 
• Extend testing regimes to include prompt and response evaluations, adversarial tests and reproducibility checks; publish release notes with model/prompt versions. 
• Maintain an AI integration catalogue capturing connectors, models, prompts, indexes, guardrail policies and audit metadata. 
• Instrument and report AI performance (latency, cost, accuracy) and recommend tuning to optimise quality and value. 
• Identify and manage AI-related risks (bias, copyright, safety) and work with the AI Governance Lead to apply mitigations. 
• Translate business needs into AI-aware technical requirements, including evaluation KPIs and data readiness criteria. 
• Provide Level 2 and 3 support for integrations, AI connectors and model usage policies. 
• Contribute to the Integration & AI Engineering Playbook, establishing secure coding, prompt pattern and evaluation standards.

• Strong commercial experience with Databricks 
• Hands‑on experience building ingestion pipelines using Auto Loader, Lakeflow, Fivetran and/or custom API/file integrations
• Strong SQL, Python and Apache Spark (PySpark) skills for large‑scale data processing
• Experience orchestrating pipelines using Databricks Workflows, Jobs, Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines and/or Delta Live Tables
• Deep understanding of incremental processing (CDC), MERGE patterns and Slowly Changing Dimensions
• Proven experience designing Lakehouse‑based data models and Medallion Architecture
• Experience implementing data quality controls using DLT expectations, Great Expectations or similar frameworks
• Strong understanding of data lineage, governance and metadata management using Unity Catalog
• Experience with Spark optimisation, partitioning, Delta Lake performance tuning and workload efficiency
• Familiarity with Git, code review processes, and promoting pipelines across environments
• Understanding of data security, sensitive data handling and access control in governed environments
• Strong communication skills and ability to collaborate with business users, analysts and technical teams

Nice to have:
• Experience with AWS services
• Exposure to DevOps practices such as Terraform, CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins), or Databricks Asset Bundles
• Knowledge of dimensional modelling (Kimball, star schemas, facts & dimensions)
• Basic understanding of ML/AI concepts, including preparing structured/unstructured data for ML or agent use cases
There will also be opportunities to expand your skillset into platform engineering, cloud, and visualisation, supported by mentoring and cross‑functional collaboration.
Please reach out via isabelle.ho2@hudson.com with your contact number and resume in Microsoft Word format if you are interested.

(Tip for successful consideration: Your resume should clearly outline your hands-on contributions, decision making responsibility, and commercial impact. We rely solely on the information provided in your application and cannot infer experience not explicitly stated.)
