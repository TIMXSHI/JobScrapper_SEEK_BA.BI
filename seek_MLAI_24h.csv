This is about shaping how AI powers a platform used by over a million people globally systems that are operationally serious, ethically guided, and scaling fast.

You’ll work alongside a team of ~40 world-class engineers, recently strengthened by senior talent from top-performing product and scale-up environments. The technical bar has never been higher, and the culture is defined by:


Technical excellence


Clear system design thinking


High ownership and accountability


Fast iteration and calibration


Customer-first decision making


You’ll report to a senior engineering leader who also oversees AI and platform strategy. Expect real architectural discussions, not surface-level decisions.

The company is now AI-first, investing heavily in responsible, human-guided AI to tackle real-world, non-clinical health and safety challenges. And this is just the beginning, the AI layer is becoming core to the platform experience.

The Problem You’ll Own

The platform is at a pivotal point:

Two fully scaled systems, front-end and back-end, need to evolve together without slowing down.


AI-driven services, from predictive triage to intelligent automation are now central to how the platform delivers impact.


Every architectural choice you make today will shape how millions of people get help tomorrow.


The Work You’ll Do
Build and scale features across front-end and back-end, integrating AI thoughtfully.


Prototype, experiment, and ship AI/ML capabilities that genuinely improve outcomes.


Influence system design and architecture for reliability, performance, and scale.


Mentor peers and elevate engineering standards across the team.


Extra credibility: showcasing outside projects, open-source contributions, or personal AI work is highly regarded.


The Profile That Excels
3+ years full-stack experience (React/Angular/Vue + Node.js/Python/Java)


Hands-on AI/ML experience (TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenAI, Hugging Face, LangChain)


Cloud-native expertise (AWS/GCP/Azure) and modern CI/CD practices


Comfortable designing scalable APIs (REST/GraphQL) and distributed systems


Thrives in high-bar, high-accountability environments


Why This Role Stands Out
You see the real impact of your work on people’s lives.


You’ll get architectural ownership over a platform at global scale.


You’ll collaborate with engineers from top product-led companies.


Flexible hybrid work, ESOP, wellbeing support, and study leave.


This role isn’t about tickets. It’s for engineers who want to own the technical direction of AI in a high-impact platform. If that’s you, let’s talk, the next three to five years of your career could be defined here.

This is not a job. This is a build mission.

We are building real AI systems that remove friction, create leverage, and scale businesses beyond human limits.

This requires a certain type of person.

Someone who builds.

Someone who finishes.

Someone who backs themselves.

The Code We Live By

Heart and soul.

Push the boundaries.

Back yourself and each other.

Do what you say you will do.

This is non-negotiable.
