Strong backend engineering experience (with full-stack exposure advantageous)

Experience building and operating microservices in cloud-native environments

A deep appreciation for performance and latency considerations — particularly in real-time or voice-based systems

Experience modernising legacy platforms while balancing delivery risk and operational stability

The ability to operate across multiple squads and influence technical outcomes at crew level

Strong enterprise architecture awareness, including domain boundaries and integration complexity




Highly regarded:

Experience with conversational AI, voice platforms, or contact centre technologies

Exposure to generative AI platforms (e.g., OpenAI, Copilot Studio) and agentic orchestration patterns

Experience supporting high-volume, customer-facing digital or conversational platforms

https://www.realtimetraffic.com.au/

Real Time Traffic (RTT) is Australia's leading AI and computer vision company for road safety. We work with transport agencies across multiple states to deploy AI-powered camera systems that detect near-misses, identify high-risk sites, and support proactive decision-making that saves lives.

Our technology is live at hundreds of locations across Australia, with thousands more planned. We're in a high-growth phase with a roadmap to expand internationally.

As demand accelerates, we're scaling fast and we're looking for a high-calibre engineer who wants real responsibility early.




The Mission of This Role




Our engineering team is heavily involved in day-to-day delivery execution. That model doesn't scale, and it doesn't allow us to evolve the platform at the pace the market demands.

We need someone exceptional who can:

Absorb delivery complexity

Engineer scalable interim solutions

Reduce operational drag

Identify repeat patterns in client needs

Convert real-world friction into validated product improvements

This role starts close to delivery but it is designed to evolve into core platform ownership. We are deliberately building this role as a bridge between real-world deployment complexity and long-term platform design.




Why This Role Is Exciting




This role gives you:

Exposure to live AI systems operating at national scale

Direct visibility of how product decisions affect real deployments

Responsibility to design pragmatic, production-grade solutions

A pathway into core platform architecture and roadmap input

If you perform and choose to, you will progressively transition from delivery-focused engineering into proactive system development and platform evolution.

We are intentionally hiring for someone who wants that trajectory.




What You'll Be Doing




1. Engineer Creative Scalable Solutions Under Real Constraints

Work directly with the delivery team to solve technical bottlenecks

Extend existing systems intelligently (not hack around them)

Design reusable tooling and automation to eliminate recurring manual work

Improve quality, reliability, and turnaround time across deployments

2. Turn Delivery Friction into Product Insight

Identify patterns in client requirements that exceed current platform capabilities

Validate whether these represent scalable product opportunities

Contribute structured thinking into roadmap discussions

Help us decide what becomes permanent product vs. what remains bespoke)

3. Work with Real Data & Applied AI

Analyse traffic, behavioural, and video-derived datasets

Build Python-based processing and validation tools

Contribute to LLM-driven reporting and automation workflows

Support refinement of AI-enabled operational systems

Improve how we operationalise machine learning outputs




Tech Environment




Languages: Python (pandas, numpy), JavaScript

Cloud: AWS (Lambda, S3, Kinesis, EMR)

Databases: MongoDB

Tools: Git, Jupyter, Docker, Linux, CI/CD tools

Other Technologies in Use: OpenCV for computer vision, LLM-based automation tools, ISO 27001 security frameworks

You must be genuinely excited about applying AI to solve real operational problems.




Our Values




Compassion – We build technology that protects lives. We care about our clients, our communities, and each other. Impact matters and so do people.

Accountability – We take ownership of outcomes, not just tasks. We hold ourselves to high standards and stand behind our work.

Responsiveness – We move with urgency and clarity. Whether supporting clients or teammates, we act decisively and communicate openly.

Excellence – We pursue technical rigour and continuous improvement. We challenge assumptions, refine systems, and raise the bar.

Safety – Safety is not a feature; it's our purpose. From secure systems to safer roads, we engineer responsibly and think long term.




About You




This role is for someone who:

Has 2 years of strong engineering experience

Thinks in systems, not tickets

Enjoys ambiguity and solving messy real-world problems

Can balance pragmatism with long-term thinking

Proactively takes ownership and closes loops without supervision

Communicates clearly and directly

Required

Degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Data Science, or similar

Intermediate level Python development experience with demonstrated ability to build data processing and validation tools

Experience working with data-heavy systems

Comfortable working in cloud environments

Melbourne-based (or relocating)

Must have current Australian work rights at the time of application

Strongly Valued

Exposure to AI/ML workflows

Experience building internal tooling or automation

Experience supporting operational or delivery teams

High intellectual curiosity




What Success Looks Like (12–18 Months)




Delivery reliance on core engineers significantly reduced

Recurring manual processes automated

Interim solutions structured and reusable

Clear product opportunities identified and validated

Active contribution to core platform evolution

Participation in architectural discussions

If you're exceptional, this role evolves into:

Core platform engineer

Technical lead on scalable modules

Strategic contributor to RTT's long-term product direction




How to Apply

Please submit your CV and a brief introduction via Seek.
Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis. Apply early to be considered.

This Role Is Not For:

Engineers who prefer clearly scoped tickets

Those uncomfortable with ambiguity

People who want to stay narrowly specialised

This role is for someone who wants to grow fast, take ownership early, and help build a category leader."
