The Opportunity

We are seeking a highly capable Power BI Developer to design, build and evolve robust semantic models, data pipelines and reporting solutions that deliver trusted, scalable and insight-driven outcomes across the enterprise. Sitting at the intersection of analytics engineering and business intelligence, this role combines strong Power BI expertise with data engineering capability to deliver high-quality, governed and performant analytics solutions.

Working closely with Data Engineers, Analysts and business stakeholders, you will translate complex requirements into scalable data and reporting solutions while contributing to data governance and platform optimisation. As our analytics capability matures, you will also leverage Generative AI and AI-assisted development tools to accelerate solution delivery, optimise DAX and SQL development, automate documentation and enhance insight generation across Cleanaway’s data ecosystem.

In this role, you will:

Design, develop and maintain Power BI semantic models, reports and dashboards aligned to enterprise standards
Develop and optimise data pipelines, ETL/ELT processes and curated data models to support analytics consumption
Partner with stakeholders to gather and translate requirements into scalable BI and analytics solutions
Implement dimensional data models (star schemas) to support performant enterprise reporting
Integrate Power BI with Snowflake, Azure (including Synapse / Data Lake) and on-premise data sources
Monitor and optimise semantic model performance (DAX, storage, refresh, capacity utilisation)
Utilise Gen AI and AI-assisted tooling to accelerate development, automate repetitive tasks, enhance documentation and improve insight discovery

About You

Proven experience developing Power BI semantic models and advanced DAX measures
Strong capability in SQL and data transformation, with experience building or supporting ETL/ELT pipelines
Solid understanding of dimensional modelling (Kimball / star schema design)
Experience working with cloud-based data platforms such as Snowflake, Azure Synapse or similar
Working knowledge of Git and modern development practices (version control, CI/CD concepts)
Experience using tools such as Tabular Editor to optimise and manage semantic models
Demonstrated ability to balance business engagement with technical solution design
Interest in and practical exposure to AI-assisted development tools, automation, and modern analytics engineering practices
Strong analytical mindset with attention to detail, performance optimisation and scalable design

This is an excellent opportunity to play a pivotal role in advancing Cleanaway’s enterprise analytics capability – combining strong Power BI development, data engineering fundamentals and emerging AI-enabled practices to drive meaningful business outcomes.
