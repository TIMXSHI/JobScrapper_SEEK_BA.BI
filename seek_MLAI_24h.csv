About the Role

As a core member of the AI Risk team, you will build specialized AI Agents that directly impact financial security. You will leverage LLMs (Large Language Models) to process unstructured data, automate complex investigation workflows, and optimize the signal-to-noise ratio in our alert systems.

Responsibilities

Design “Sherlock”-style autonomous agents to investigate suspicious fraud activity
Build reasoning-capable agents that analyze user behavior, device fingerprints, and trading history to assess whether withdrawals are fraudulent or safe
Develop market manipulation detection agents that analyze unstructured social sentiment alongside order book data
Identify pump-and-dump schemes and wash trading
Build LLM-based triage systems to handle high volumes of risk alerts
Use agents to pre-screen alerts by analyzing alert context and historical false positives
Automatically decide whether to close alerts or escalate them to human analysts
Reduce alert fatigue for Ops teams by filtering noise with high semantic understanding
Use LLMs to extract features from messy, unstructured data such as chat logs, support tickets, KYC documents, and chat groups
Convert vague risk signals into structured features (e.g., JSON) for downstream risk models or rule engines
Build RAG pipelines that allow agents to query repositories of past fraud cases and identify recurring patterns
Develop analyst copilot tools to draft investigation reports (SARs) and summarize complex cases
Enable human-in-the-loop workflows where agents gather evidence, propose decisions, and humans review and approve outcomes
Requirements

LLM application experience: 2+ years building applications with GPT, Claude, or other open-source LLM models
Agent frameworks: Deep familiarity with LangGraph, LangChain, or CrewAI
RAG for domain knowledge: Experience building retrieval systems that fetch relevant contextual information
Evaluation (crucial): Proven ability to design evaluation sets to measure agent performance, such as correctly identifying fraudsters versus regular users
Python mastery: Ability to write production-ready, maintainable code (not just scripts)
Data engineering: Proficiency in SQL and experience working with data pipelines (e.g., Kafka, Spark) to provide agents with real-time data
Domain interest (bonus): Understanding of Trust & Safety, anti-fraud, or financial risk domains
Crypto familiarity (bonus): Knowledge of on-chain analysis, DeFi concepts, and wallet addresses
Anomaly detection (bonus): Experience with anomaly detection concepts and techniques
Educational background: Master’s degree with 2+ years of experience, or equivalent hands-on expertise in Data Science, AI Engineering, or Applied ML
Scale & systems experience: Experience working with terabyte-scale datasets and real-time systems
Financial systems knowledge (preferred): Understanding of financial markets, trading systems, or risk management
Adaptability: Comfortable working in fast-changing, ambiguous 0→1 environments with the ability to prototype, iterate quickly, and drive execution
Passion for AI: Strong interest in AI agents, autonomous systems, LLMs, or intelligent automation
Communication skills: Strong English reading and writing skills for technical documentation and agent prompt engineering

Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora,你好, hallo, vítejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point. 

Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney, with a second campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, and Auckland, NZ. You have flexibility in how and where you work — whether that's from one of our spaces, from home, or a mix of both. This role is remote-friendly within Australia or New Zealand, so you can choose the setup that empowers you and your team to do your best work.

Job Description


About the Team

The Revenue Platform group is building Canva’s global monetization engine: a payments platform that processes billions in volume across 190+ countries. The Global Payments team owns the systems that ensure anyone, anywhere can pay for Canva—reliably, securely, and with high conversion.

About the Role

This role is for a senior ML engineer who will build decisioning and optimisation models that sit at the heart of Canva’s payments orchestration layer.

You will be the first machine learning engineer embedded in Global Payments and have the opportunity to define the ML strategy, foundations, and operating model for payments optimisation within the team.

This role is highly cross-functional: you’ll work with payments engineering, data, fraud, and product to ship ML that measurably improves revenue outcomes and customer experience.

What we're looking for

Technical skills

Demonstrated experience building and shipping ML systems end-to-end (feature design → training → evaluation → deployment → monitoring).

Domain knowledge of supervised learning and decisioning systems; experience with exploration/exploitation approaches (bandits) is a plus.

Ability to work with large-scale, noisy transactional data and produce reliable models.

Strong software engineering fundamentals: testing, code quality, APIs, and operational ownership.

Python proficiency; experience with common ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch / TensorFlow / scikit-learn).


Product and platform mindsets

Strong judgment on trade-offs and risk: understands how ML can fail and how to design safe rollouts.

Comfortable working in ambiguous problem spaces and turning them into clear, measurable deliverables.

Ability to communicate clearly with stakeholders across engineering, product, finance, and risk.


Domain experience (nice to have)

Payments, fraud/risk, credit card authorisation, retries/dunning, routing, or experimentation in high-stakes systems.

Familiarity with compliance constraints (PCI scope minimisation, auditability, access controls) in financial systems.

Additional Information
