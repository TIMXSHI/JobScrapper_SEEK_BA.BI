This is not surface-level AI adoption. It is about building the internal platforms, automation frameworks and AI-assisted workflows that materially change how software is designed, written and delivered. They are hiring two Technical Leads to help shape and build that future.

The Opportunity

This team operates at the intersection of:

LLM integration
AI-assisted development
Developer experience platforms
SDLC automation
Internal tooling engineering

You will sit between architectural direction and engineering delivery, turning GenAI strategy into production-grade systems. This role is approximately 50% hands-on coding.

What You’ll Be Doing

Designing and implementing low-level architecture for GenAI developer tooling initiatives
Building proof-of-concepts and production-ready AI-integrated components
Embedding LLMs into engineering workflows and IDE environments
Developing internal tooling using Go, Java (SpringBoot) and TypeScript (React / Next.js)
Implementing automation via GitHub workflows, webhooks and API integrations
Optimising AI workflows for performance, cost and governance
Mentoring and uplifting a growing GenAI engineering team
Partnering with engineering squads to embed AI into live delivery projects
Participating in incident response and post-mortem improvement
This is platform engineering combined with applied AI at scale.

What They’re Looking For

You are a deeply hands-on senior engineer or staff-level technical leader who:
Has built real LLM integrations into production systems
Understands token limits, hallucination behaviour, cost trade-offs and security implications
Has experience building internal tooling or developer platforms
Is fluent in backend engineering and automation patterns
Has operated in DevOps-heavy, CI/CD-driven environments
Can mentor and technically elevate engineers around you
Is curious, experimental and comfortable operating in ambiguity
You may have:

Built internal AI assistants or dev productivity tools
Integrated Claude or similar models into structured workflows
Used AI IDE tooling such as Cursor in depth
Created automation frameworks that remove friction from the SDLC
Learned through breaking and refining LLM-driven systems
They are seeking practitioners who have moved beyond experimentation into real-world application.

Why This Role Is Different
Few organisations are building enterprise-scale GenAI developer tooling as a strategic productivity initiative. This is a funded, executive-backed transformation with clear impact targets. You will help shape how thousands of engineers build software in the AI era.
