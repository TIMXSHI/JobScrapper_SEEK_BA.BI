Sydney | Hybrid

$200k - $220k + super (depending on experience) 

We’re partnering with a high-growth technology organisation building advanced detection products driven by cutting-edge algorithms and R&D. They are seeking a Lead Data Engineer to take ownership of the data platforms and tooling that underpin their core revenue-generating technology.

This is a high-impact leadership role where you will shape the data ecosystem that enables AI/ML development at scale - influencing architecture, standards, and the overall usability of data across engineering teams.

The Role

You will lead the uplift of data tools and infrastructure that support AI/ML model development and deployment. This includes enabling robust pipelines, lifecycle management, validation, and standardisation practices that allow teams to confidently build and iterate on algorithm-driven products.

A core focus of the role is improving how data is collected, ingested, stored, governed, and ultimately made accessible and usable across the organisation.

You’ll work alongside two other technical team leads within a group supporting algorithm development for detection products and R&D initiatives. As part of this, you’ll build and lead a team of three across data engineering and software engineering.

The scope and influence of this role are significant - you’ll be architecting the tools and data platforms that directly underpin the company’s primary revenue stream.

Ideal Background

We’re particularly interested in candidates who have supported AI/ML or algorithm-driven systems in technically complex environments. Relevant industry experience may include:

Autonomous systems, robotics, or drone platforms
Defence, radar, communications, or signal-processing technologies
Aerospace, satellite, or geospatial systems
Autonomous vehicles or advanced mobility
Industrial IoT or edge AI environments
Candidates from similarly rigorous engineering domains will also be considered.

Experience & Skills
Proven experience designing and delivering end-to-end data tooling and platform architecture
Strong programming capability in Python, plus at least one compiled language (Go or C++ preferred)
5+ years working with AI/ML-based systems and supporting production pipelines
3+ years leading or mentoring engineering teams
Deep understanding of data collection, ingestion, storage, and governance best practices
Experience enabling scalable, reliable data access for algorithm or model development teams
