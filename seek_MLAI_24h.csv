Nearmap is the Australian-founded, global tech pioneer innovating in location intelligence. Customers rely on Nearmap for consistent, reliable, high-resolution imagery, insights, and answers to create meaningful change in the world and propel industries forward. Harnessing its own patented camera systems, imagery capture, AI, geospatial tools, and advanced SaaS platforms, Nearmap stands as the definitive source of truth that shapes the liveable world.

Job Description


We are recruiting a hands-on Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for R&D and strong expertise in applying deep learning techniques to practical computer vision applications. You will work with an incredibly passionate and talented team of Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers, and your work will have a real impact on Nearmap products. You will train novel deep learning models that leverage our rich data sets, multiple dates of high-resolution imagery, multi-angle source imagery and 3D textured mesh. You will collaborate closely with other team members to solve various 2D and 3D vision tasks by selecting the model architecture, designing training and evaluation methodologies, generating a suitable dataset, and optimising models for deployment. The released models will run on millions of square kilometres of Nearmap imagery.

Experience in applying deep learning techniques to commercial use cases and non-academic problems is highly valued. We are committed to software best practices including infrastructure as code, GitOps, CI/CD, and as much automation as makes sense. A strong background in 3D modelling is advantageous in this role.

Key Responsibilities

Design and scope greenfield machine learning projects in collaboration with the team
Develop and deliver end-to-end solutions to complex technical problems
Train and optimize deep learning models using our extensive multi-temporal, multi-angle, and 3D imagery datasets
Participate in technical discussions, code reviews, and knowledge sharing sessions

Qualifications
