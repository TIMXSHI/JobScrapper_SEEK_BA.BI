You question legacy approaches, design from first principles, and are excited by the possibilities of AI and automation convergence.

We also value an entrepreneur's mindset — someone who can wear multiple hats, adapt fluidly to new challenges, and take on roles beyond coding to deliver meaningful business impact.
Start-up or similar experience that demonstrates versatility, ownership, and comfort operating in a fast-changing environment — whether as a founder or an early employee — will be highly regarded.

You will have:

Degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field.

5 years+ commercial experience in relevant technical role.

You'll have experience with:

Generative AI & agentic frameworks (LangChain, LangGraph, AutoGen, MCP Servers, etc.)
