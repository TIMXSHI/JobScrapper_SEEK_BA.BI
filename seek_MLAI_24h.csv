Someone who can design an industrial network, explain it clearly, test it thoroughly… and enjoys a workplace where tech meets pop culture? Seriously, check out the Madison Technologies LinkedIn page to see the magic.

If that sounds like you, keep reading, we think you’ll like it here.

Why this role is genuinely exciting

In this role you’ll work across the entire solution journey, from understanding a client’s operational requirements, to designing fit-for-purpose industrial network solutions and supporting them through to successful implementation.

 What you’ll actually be doing

This is a hybrid role, so you’ll split your time between technical pre-sales, either in the office or meeting with customers, solution design and architecture, and post-sales technical support. Occasionally, you might head out to the field to see solutions in action, run tests, or support implementation. Basically, you’ll be across the whole solution journey from understanding what the customer needs, to designing the right technology, and supporting them as it gets built and goes live.

You’ll collaborate closely with our Solutions Engineer Team Lead - the architect behind the videos that take complicated industrial tech and makes it relatable, fun, and yes, sometimes even funny. It’s the kind of content that actually makes people get what we do.

You’ll also have the freedom to experiment in our tech lab, test integrations, build demos, experiment, break things (professionally), and develop new skills as our customers evolve and new technologies emerge.

This isn't a “stay in your lane” role. It’s a broad, hybrid OT engineering opportunity where you can fully own your work, manage your schedule, and be the technical expert customer’s trust.

And here’s the fun part, this role comes with some extras that most OT gigs just don’t offer. You might deliver a training session, run a lunch and learn, help out at a trade show, build slick demo kits, or even jump into creating our playful tech content (yes, the outfit changes and dramatic device smashes are totally a thing). Occasional travel for projects or events keeps things fresh, making every day a little different and a lot more exciting.

Enough about us already, lets learn about you!

You’re someone who brings both deep technical capability and the people skills to match. Someone who can own a room, own a network design, and own a project with the support of a passionate team behind you.

Must-haves

CCNA (current)

Demonstrated experience as an OT Engineer or similar, with hands-on delivery in industries such as mining, oil & gas, utilities, energy or construction

Strong knowledge of:

Networking fundamentals & design

Industrial protocols

Operational technology hardware and communication systems

Experience supporting, configuring, testing and troubleshooting industrial network equipment

Ability to articulate technical concepts clearly to customers, colleagues and non-technical stakeholders

And the capability to present and engage with our customers in a public setting

What you’ll love about working with us

There are lots of things, obviously, but here are the top three:

A role with room to grow your skills, diversify your experience and try new technologies

The freedom to take ownership, get hands-on, and shape how solutions are designed, delivered and supported

A workplace where technical excellence meets personality, we like fun, and we like engineers who like fun too

Ready to join us?

If you’re a true OT professional who can handle the autonomy, thrives on solving real-world industrial problems, and wants a role where your technical brain gets a workout every day, we’d love to hear from you.

Apply now and bring your expertise to Madison Technologies."
