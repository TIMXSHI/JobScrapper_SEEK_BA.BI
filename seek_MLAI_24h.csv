You knew it wasn’t sustainable, but you weren’t given the mandate to fix it.

This role gives you that mandate.

Here, you’ll take responsibility for keeping critical integrations stable and reliable, while also leading the journey to a simplified, modern integration platform. You’ll inherit an environment with MuleSoft and AWS at its core, where APIs are already front-and-centre. But you’ll also help shape the next chapter: streamlining from 10+ vendors down to a best-of-breed iPaaS (Workato).

This is more than just operational support. You’ll be empowered to set standards, close gaps, reduce technical debt, and design integrations that make the business more agile. You’ll work with IT leaders who want someone decisive, someone who can own problems, figure things out quickly, and deliver outcomes.

What you’ll do

Design, build, and support integrations across enterprise apps using MuleSoft and AWS, ensuring they’re secure, scalable, and reliable.
Lead API management - from development to monitoring, gateways, and security - so data can flow seamlessly across ERP, CRM, HR and other core systems.
Tackle the current fragmentation challenge: stabilise legacy integrations while rationalising the vendor landscape, driving toward a Workato-led iPaaS future.
Deliver operational excellence: incident triage, root-cause analysis, runbooks, knowledge bases, continuous improvement.
Collaborate across IT and vendors to ensure changes, releases, and upgrades are governed, well-documented, and deliver value without disruption.

What you’ll bring

Strong hands-on experience with integration, plus proven capability in API development and management.
The ability to work with ambiguity: figuring things out when documentation is light, asking the right questions, and owning outcomes end-to-end.
Knowledge of modern integration patterns, monitoring/alerting, and operational support in complex enterprise environments.
Familiarity with ITIL/ITSM (ServiceNow/Jira), CI/CD, and good practice for governance and releases.
Bonus if you’ve worked with iPaaS platforms like Workato or Boomi, or if you’ve built reusable integration connectors and patterns.

Why this role

You’ll have impact: reducing complexity, setting integration standards, and driving toward a future-proof iPaaS.
You’ll have autonomy: a chance to “own it” from day one, solving problems and shaping the roadmap.
You’ll grow: working with modern tools, influencing the future-state architecture, and being trusted as the integration SME.

Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.

Hey, hello, hiya, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, 你好, hallo, vítejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.

What you’d be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

At the moment, this role is focused on:

Architect and code production‑ready automation services in Python/TypeScript, leveraging LangChain, LangGraph, and Canva’s internal platforms.

Take small prototypes and transform them into high quality production systems capable of being secure and resilient to the potentially thousands of people using them.

Fine‑tune, evaluate, and integrate LLMs, embeddings, and vector stores; where necessary own the full model lifecycle from experiment to rollout.

Instrument services with metrics, tracing, and alerting; own incident response and continuous improvement.

Collaborate with PMs, designers, and analysts to translate ambiguous business problems into measurable, AI‑powered solutions.

You're probably a match if

You have shipped AI or automation solutions that materially reduce manual effort and streamline processes.

You bring strong system-integration and troubleshooting skills across complex tech environments.

You communicate technical concepts clearly to engineers, Product Managers, designers, and leadership teams.

You take ownership, work autonomously, and flourish in a high-trust, collaborative culture.

You understand security, compliance, and governance requirements in enterprise settings.security, compliance, and governance requ

You stay curious - always learning, experimenting, and finding smarter ways to solve problems.

You possess a solid software development background and enjoy building at the edge of what’s possible.


About the team

This role will be embedded within the Content & Discovery supergroup, which sits at the heart of connecting our users with the right content at the right time. Our mission is to make Canva’s vast library of templates, elements, and media easily searchable, discoverable, and personalized, so every user finds inspiration and can create faster.


AI is one of Canva’s biggest goals. We’ve already shipped world‑class capabilities, from in‑house models to intelligent tools used by millions, but the biggest unlock is still ahead. Many of our internal workflows remain manual, decisions are slower than they should be, and data is often under‑used.

As a Senior AI Automation Engineer you’ll embed with teams across Canva to turn their manual processes into machine‑powered, always‑on systems. You’ll prototype in days, iterate quickly, and prove value before others finish writing the brief. Your work will help thousands of Canvanauts move faster and unlock 10× outcomes at scale.

What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a stack of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

Here's a taste of what's on offer:

Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too

Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers

An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more

Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally
