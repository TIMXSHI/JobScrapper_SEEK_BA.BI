The role

At Elula, data is the foundation of our AI-as-a-Service platform. As a Senior Data Engineer, you'll be the person who truly understands that data: where it comes from, what it means, how it behaves, and how to shape it into something reliable and useful.

Most of your best work will happen before you write any code; in understanding what the data represents, where it came from, and how it fits into our products. You'll spend your time interrogating complex datasets, designing thoughtful data models, and building the transformation logic that turns raw inputs into trusted, high-quality outputs powering our models and products. You won't just move data - you'll make sense of it.

You'll work autonomously on open-ended problems alongside data scientists, software engineers, and customer-facing teams, contributing across the full data lifecycle from ingestion and modelling through to validation and delivery. We're a collaborative, ambitious team, and we're looking for someone who takes genuine ownership, communicates clearly across disciplines, and isn't afraid to ask the hard questions about the data in front of them.

To be successful in this role, you will be expected to demonstrate the following skills and experience.
 

What You’ll Bring

Data transformation and modelling

A deep curiosity for data - you naturally interrogate datasets to understand their shape, quality, and fitness for purpose before building anything.

Strong applied data modelling skills, designing structures that serve analytical, operational and downstream use cases well.

The ability to develop and optimise complex SQL across large datasets, with a sharp eye for correctness, performance and long-term maintainability.

Comfortable using Python to automate workflows and building reusable tooling that makes the team more effective.

Ownership and judgement

You own your work end-to-end, from design decisions through to ongoing reliability, exercising sound technical judgement when trade-offs arise and proactively keeping stakeholders informed.

You manage your own priorities and delivery with discipline, and help your team do the same without waiting to be asked.

When something's wrong with the data, you dig in, diagnose it systematically, and fix it pragmatically, then share what you learned so the same issue doesn't come back.

 Technical leadership

You communicate complex data concepts clearly to both technical colleagues and non-technical stakeholders - translating between the two comes naturally.

You actively support and uplift junior engineers, sharing context, approaches and best practices generously.

You bring curiosity and a continuous improvement mindset, staying across new tools and techniques and contributing to raising the bar for the whole team.

You know how to get the most out of AI-assisted development tools like Claude Code - using them as an amplifier to think bigger and spend your energy on problems that genuinely require human judgment.

 

Nice to Have

While the following are not required, they are highly valued.

A background in a quantitative discipline such as computer science, mathematics or statistics.

Experience working in the financial services industry (e.g. banking, insurance or superannuation)


Benefits

Elula’s people are at the core of all we do. Our benefits are just one way we show that.

Enjoy flexible working hours, and work from home two days per week, to better balance your personal and professional life.

Experience the freedom of working anywhere in Australia up to five days annually.

Give back to what matters to you with extra paid annual leave for volunteering.

Put your health first with an allowance for fitness and wellbeing.

Drive your development with financial support for approved training courses.

Level up with matched funding for career coaching.
