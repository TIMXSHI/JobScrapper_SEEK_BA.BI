Some prefer the safety of large corporate teams.
Some chase FAANG logos.

And then there are the ones who just want to do great work with real-world AI — wherever the challenge is.

If you're in that last group, read on.

We're hiring a Data Scientist for a PE-backed AI consultancy with a growing national footprint (currently sub-10 people, but scaling fast). This team thrives on tackling high-impact, technically complex problems — from GenAI tooling to agent-based AI systems and government-grade infrastructure.

This role is open only to Australian Citizens due to upcoming work with federal agencies — if you have experience in or exposure to government departments, that’s a plus (but not essential).

What you’ll be doing:


Building and deploying ML models and GenAI systems


Working hands-on with AI agents, LLM pipelines, and secure environments


Seeing your work go to production, not just proof-of-concept


Collaborating with senior DS mentors who bring deep R&D and commercial expertise


What you bring:


3+ years hands-on experience in Data Science


Strong Python skills across modelling and data wrangling


Experience working with LLMs or AI agents (bonus points)


Models in production (not just notebooks)


PhD preferred, but not required


Bonus: any background working on government or regulated data projects


Location:


Melbourne preferred
Open to Sydney-based candidates for the right fit
Must be an Australian Citizen (due to project security requirements)

Want to work with smart people, ship real AI solutions, and get your hands dirty?

Build, deploy, and enjoy.
