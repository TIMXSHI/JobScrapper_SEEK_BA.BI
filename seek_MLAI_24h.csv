90194950,Machine Learning Engineer,The Onset,https://www.seek.com.au/job/90194950?type=standard&ref=search-standalone&origin=jobCard#sol=ed68d4c52cbb7ef2bfe3207e45d165e49484cd65,8h ago,8.0,2026-02-06T23:00:00+00:00,Sydney NSW (Remote),Engineering - Software (Information & Communication Technology),Full time,"$150,000 + Super","94.7% of AI projects don’t make it to production.

I have zero data to back this up.

Do you know what the actual figure is?

The manager I’m recruiting for will have a more informed view on what the actual percentage may be.

If you’re interested in having an intellectual argument (or many) about such things you should keep reading.

Machine Learning Engineer wanted! (not exclusively for arguing!).

Some real AI work is being done.

Yes, that’s right – live ML models in production, customers paying, challenges with scale, evolving datasets, model valuation, and all the practical realities that come with it.

You’re probably working in machine learning or deep learning somewhere highly technical now.

Maybe you love what you’re doing but feel constrained by tooling, data access, or process.

Maybe you enjoy modelling but don’t want to drift into pure MLOps.

Maybe you just want to work with strong technical people on meaningful problems (everyone is hands on in this team).

Over the next 6 months and beyond, you’ll be training and iterating on ML / DL models using real datasets, working on model valuation and experimentation, contributing to 3D modelling and computer vision problems (3D experience is a big bonus, not a requirement), helping improve how data is queried and sampled as the team moves away from manual workflows toward more dynamic, database-driven access, and strengthening parts of the ML lifecycle from training through to evaluation, iteration and deployment.

This isn’t a notebook-only role, and it’s not a production-only MLOps role either. It’s about building models and improving the systems around them.

You don’t need encyclopaedic knowledge of recent vision research, but as someone in ML you should have a reasonable understanding of things like CNNs vs Transformers and be curious about modern approaches.

You’ll have personally trained ML or DL models on meaningful datasets, iterated on performance through experimentation, worked on evaluation or model valuation, and taken models beyond toy projects or university capstones.

On the engineering side, you’ll be comfortable working in shared Python codebases using Git, building repeatable training and evaluation workflows, improving existing systems rather than starting from scratch each time, and contributing to ML infrastructure without being a full-time platform engineer. SQL experience is important – the team is moving toward more dynamic, query-driven data workflows.

Nice to haves include 3D computer vision or 3D modelling, Airflow, Metaflow or similar orchestration tools, GPU or distributed training, and cloud ML workflows – but these are bonuses, and the team can help you grow here.

You’ll join a highly technical ML team tackling complex geospatial problems at scale. This is an environment for people who enjoy strong technical discussions, pragmatic problem solving, sharing knowledge, and owning problems end to end. Previous hires from this group have gone on to technical leadership roles in startups – growth is very much part of the picture.

An Honours degree or higher in a quantitative or technical discipline (Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Mathematics, Statistics, or similar) is a minimum requirement. Masters, PhD, or equivalent international qualifications are also accepted.
Interview process:

Technical discussion with the hiring manager to understand your approach to ML problems, modelling, data and systems.

Coding Assignment: 1 week to complete take home task (you can use Co-Pilot, just please disclose that you are, for what and why).

Panel interview – Business introductions and deep technical-solutioning (think design and ML engineering).

This role is open to remote, but Eastern seaboard Australia-based candidates only.

About the Group/Team

Canva Research – Design Generation

We’re building the systems that turn imagination into reality. Within Canva Research, the Design Generation group focuses on creating AI models and pipelines that produce beautiful designs for Canvas users. We work at the intersection of research and product, partnering closely with Product, Design, and Engineering to ship AI-powered experiences that feel magical, reliable, and deeply human. Our work directly shapes how users create, explore, and express ideas in Canva every day.

About the Role/Specialty:

As a Senior Research Engineer, we sit at the boundary between research and production. We explore new ideas in generative modelling, evaluate their real-world impact, and turn promising research into scalable systems that power Canva’s design experiences. As a Senior Research Engineer, this role operates with a high degree of autonomy, solving complex problems, influencing technical direction, and collaborating across teams to deliver meaningful outcomes. Our success is measured not just by research quality, but by the impact our work has on real users.

What you’ll do (responsibilities):

You’ll design, experiment with, and evaluate generative AI models for design-focused use cases.

You’ll translate research outcomes into scalable, production-ready systems.

You’ll collaborate closely with Product, Design, and Engineering partners to align research with user needs.

You’ll analyse model performance using both quantitative metrics and qualitative user signals.

You’ll contribute to technical discussions, architecture decisions, and long-term AI strategy.

You’ll share learnings through documentation, reviews, and internal presentations to uplift the broader team.

What we're looking for:


You’re an accomplished applied researcher who loves seeing ideas land in the hands of real users. You’re comfortable navigating ambiguity, balancing research depth with practical constraints, and making thoughtful trade-offs. You bring solid experience in machine learning or generative modelling, enjoy collaborating across disciplines, and care deeply about quality, ethics, and impact. You’re motivated by solving meaningful problems at scale and excited by the challenge of building AI that empowers creativity.

Experience with generative models: Proficient in working with large language models (LLMs), diffusion models, and multimodal architectures to develop innovative solutions.

Skills in training generative models: Experienced in techniques such as fine-tuning, in-context learning, and reinforcement learning to optimise model performance.

Proficiency in deep learning frameworks: Skilled in leveraging tools like PyTorch, JAX, and HuggingFace for advanced research and experimentation.

Expertise in experimental design and evaluation: Capable of implementing experimental design strategies for generative models, using both quantitative metrics and qualitative analysis to assess outcomes.

Ability to enhance research tooling and workflows: Experienced in rapid prototyping, conducting ablation studies, and tracking experiments to streamline research processes.

Competence in data curation and analysis: Adept at managing and analysing datasets for training and evaluating generative systems.

Familiarity with current research literature: Skilled at reproducing impactful papers and applying novel techniques to address emerging problem spaces.
