About You and Your Skills

 

We’re looking for an Engineering Manager with experience managing product led ML and/or data engineering teams.

You'll bring the ability to institute change and uplift ways of working, driving cultural and technical transformation within the engineering team. Educating, coaching and upskilling your team, and providing opportunities for continuous learning will be integral to your role. You'll define modern engineering practices, embed them in the team, and foster a culture of continuous improvement.

You'll have experience working in product-led organisations focused on continuous iteration and value delivery. This will be reflected in your experience with Agile delivery models, building software and ML/AI solutions following a modern SDLC built around automation and CI/CD.

 

Further, you’ll have:

 

Proven experience in the data and AI domain, particularly in building, developing, and supporting production-grade AI solutions
Demonstrated ability to lead and manage multi-disciplinary teams (including ML Engineers, Software Engineers, and Data Engineers) while collaborating effectively with partners such as product managers, security specialists, and architects
Strong product mindset, with the capability to translate business objectives into practical, scalable technical solutions

Cloud Platform: Azure (AKS, Foundry, AML)
Infrastructure & DevOps: Docker, Terraform, Azure DevOps, CI/CD pipelines
Languages: Python, R, TypeScript (React)
Data Engineering: DataBricks, Snowflake, DBT
Machine Learning: PyTorch, scikit-learn, MLOps practices
AI Frameworks: LangChain, Semantic Kernel
Development Practices: Agile, GitOps, CI/CD, IaC, Microservice Architecture

 

We recognise that candidates will bring diverse combinations of skills and experience. While experience with these specific tools is valuable, we're equally interested in your ability to learn, adapt, and lead teams through technological change. We encourage you to apply if you have experience with similar tools and are passionate about technology, innovation, and developing high-performing engineering teams.

 

Additionally, we are not just looking for someone with technical or leadership skills and expertise, we value cultural fit and we value diversity in the team in the pursuit of excellence and innovation.

 

General Skills

 

Building strong collaborative relationships and effectively communicating technical concepts across teams with diverse backgrounds and skillsets
Passionate about developing engineers and sharing best practices in software development, data engineering, and MLOps
Comfortable with agile ways of working, balancing the need for quality with near-term business benefit
Demonstrating empathy and strong interpersonal skills, with a genuine interest in people growth and career development
Good understanding of software architecture and enterprise integration patterns
