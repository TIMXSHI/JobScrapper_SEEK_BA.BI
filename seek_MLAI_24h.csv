Their platform sits at the intersection of forecasting, automation, and agentic AI, and data infrastructure is the backbone of it all.

This is a critical technical hire as you will take ownership of a large, complex Databricks environment. You will rebuild the entire eco-system to enable scale with confidence, speed, and cost discipline. This is not a maintenance role, it is a platform reset.

You will own DataOps and MLOps across AWS and Databricks, acting as both hands-on engineer and architectural decision-maker. The first part of this role is the responsibility of a full overhaul of the entire Databricks platform, while working closely with the founders, data science, and AI team.

This role is for someone who thrives in fast-paced scale-up environments and is comfortable pushing boundaries.

The Role:

You will lead a complete Databricks environment revamp
Migrating off a legacy metastore to Unity Catalog
Re-architect orchestration using Databricks tooling such as Lakeflow Jobs and Flows
Improving cost efficiency and observability across large datasets at multi-billion record scale
Establishing strong data governance foundations, including GDPR-aware handling of PII
Designing clean, scalable dimensional models suited to analytics and ML workloads
This work directly impacts platform reliability, ML velocity, and company margins.

Responsibilities

Own DataOps and MLOps across AWS and Databricks
Design, build, and operate reliable ingestion and orchestration pipelines across batch, streaming, and CDC workloads
Own the MLOps platform, currently SageMaker and Step Functions, with the mandate to evolve or migrate to Databricks MLflow where it makes sense
Set standards for data quality, lineage, testing, and observability
Drive cost efficiency and FinOps discipline across the data platform
Partner closely with data science, AI, and security to ensure the platform is trusted, compliant, and scalable
Make clear architectural decisions and be accountable for outcomes

Required Experience

Deep hands-on experience with Databricks in production environments
Strong experience with Unity Catalog and modern Databricks orchestration patterns
Solid understanding of data governance concepts, especially around PII and compliance
Experience designing dimensional models for analytics and Machine Learning
Strong AWS fundamentals (Bedrock, Sagemaker, Step Functions EC2)
Comfortable working with dbt, PySpark & PostgreSQL
Experience operating data platforms at scale

Nice to Have

Exposure to Databricks Genie or AI-assisted development workflows
Familiarity with agentic systems, LLM tooling, or AI copilots

NB:

Applicants must be located in Sydney
Must have Australian Permanent Residency/Citizenship

Package

Base salary in the range of $170k to $180k plus super
Strong equity through ESOP
Performance-based incentives tied to platform outcomes and impact"
