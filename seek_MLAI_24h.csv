$140k + super + equity

Want to work on production AI serving thousands of customers globally?

If so, you could join a Sequoia-backed team building an AI-powered workflow platform that’s changing how global companies automate and scale their operations.

Having just received a $20m funding Sequoia, they are now taking their AI tools to production and they’re looking for smart, ambitious engineers to help shape the product.

This is a chance to join the AI team in a scaling start-up early, where your ideas and code make a direct impact, and you’re surrounded by people who genuinely love what they do.

Why join

A company that truly lives its values where everyone describes the team as supportive, ambitious, and genuinely good humans to work with.

Culture of autonomy and trust with high flexibility, low ego and high impact. Engineers are trusted to take ownership and make decisions but you’ll also have the support of a seriously impressive team around you.

You’d work across modern technologies including TypeScript, React, Node.js, Golang, and AWS, learning from experienced product engineers in a collaborative environment. You’ll build real-world AI and ship features that bring AI into everyday workflows for enterprise users. This isn’t an ML role, it;s pure software but you’ll be working with LLMs and integrating AI into the platform.

It’s hybrid work from their Sydney CBD office (Tuesdays & Fridays), fully stocked kitchen, team lunches, regular social events, and epic annual offsites (Bali, Korea and Malaysia were the last three).

The Role

As a Software Engineer for the AI product, you’ll work within a small team, building greenfield products.

You’ll:


Work across the stack using React, TypeScript, Node.js


Build and maintain scalable systems on AWS


Collaborate on AI integrations that deliver real customer value


Be part of a product journey from beta to full-scale production


This is a great opportunity for someone mid-level 2 years’ experience who wants to learn fast, work with cutting-edge tech, and see their work make an impact.

You’ll need to be product focused - if you expect to be given tickets and they go off and work on them, this won’t happen. You’ll be working with the AI lead to understand what impact these solutions have in the real-world and deliver them.
