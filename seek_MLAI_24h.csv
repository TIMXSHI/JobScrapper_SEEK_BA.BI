We’re redefining what a customer communications platform can be—by combining voice, SMS, WhatsApp, and AI into one seamless workspace.

Our momentum comes from a simple but powerful idea: help every customer-facing team work smarter, not harder. Aircall’s AI Voice Agent automates routine calls, AI Assist streamlines post-call tasks, and AI Assist Pro delivers real-time guidance that helps people do their best work. The result—companies grow revenue, deliver faster resolutions, and scale service.

We’ve built a product customers love and a business that scales fast. Aircall operates in nine global offices (Paris, New York, San Francisco, Sydney, Madrid, London, Berlin, Seattle, and Mexico City), and is backed by world-class investors. Our teams are shipping AI innovation faster than ever and expanding across new product lines and markets.

At Aircall, you’ll join a company in motion—ambitious, profitable, and product-driven—where impact is visible, decisions are fast, and growth is real.

How We Work at Aircall: At Aircall, we believe in customer obsession, continuous learning, and delivering extraordinary outcomes. We value open collaboration, taking ownership, and making smart, informed decisions with speed and precision. If you thrive in a fast-paced, team-driven environment where curiosity, trust, and impact matter, you'll fit right in

About the Team

Aircall’s Forward Deployed Engineering team connects our innovative AI Agents technology to real-world SMB workflows. We turn possibility into production — delivering automation that improves customer experience, boosts productivity, and unlocks new business value. Working cross-functionally with Product, Engineering, Sales, Solutions, and Customer Success, the team ensures every deployment delivers measurable impact. This is a dynamic, hands-on role at the intersection of technical consulting, project leadership, and AI adoption strategy. You don’t need to be a full-time software engineer, but you should be fluent in APIs, very confident managing technical projects, and eager to continuously learn, build, and scale new models that empower both customers and teammates.

About the Role

As a Forward-Deployed Engineer, you’ll own the end-to-end delivery of technically sound, low-code AI solutions for Aircall customers. You’ll design, implement, and operationalize workflows that connect the AI Agent with CRMs, help desks, and communication tools. You’ll also play a key role in driving team upskilling, building reusable frameworks, and leading cross-functional initiatives that improve how Aircall deploys AI at scale. This is a hands-on role where you’ll translate customer challenges into scalable technical solutions, working directly with Product and Engineering to refine Aircall’s platform and accelerate adoption.

What you'll do:

Lead customer discovery and design sessions to map business processes, identify automation opportunities, and define solution architecture.
Design, build, and deploy integrations using low/no-code platforms (Zapier, Make, n8n, Workato) and CRM automation tools (HubSpot Workflows, Salesforce Flow) with API connectors.
Collaborate with Engineering to validate technical feasibility, resolve blockers, and share field learnings that inform product improvements.
Configure and optimize the AI Agent — defining intents, prompts, actions, guardrails, and performance metrics.
Manage complex, cross-functional deployments — defining timelines, aligning stakeholders, ensuring accountability, and delivering on time and within scope.
Create scalable models and reusable frameworks (templates, playbooks, reference architectures) that make future projects faster and more consistent.
Champion continuous learning and enablement — train peers, run internal workshops, and document best practices to raise the technical bar across the team.
Run global, targeted outbound campaigns within the existing customer base to generate pipeline and accelerate adoption, working closely with the customer marketing team.
Collaborate with GTM leadership to embed routines and cadences that drive accountability for new product pipeline, forecast accuracy, and performance tracking.
Own regional top-line targets for assigned products (e.g., AI Voice Agent MRR generated per area) by collaborating with AEs and AMs who hold add-on quotas.
Act as an internal product owner within the GTM function—defining product-specific MRR strategies, coordinating cross-functional support, and ensuring Aircall delivers the leading AI-enabled communication platform.
Collaborate with Product and PMM to shape the AI Voice Agent roadmap based on customer needs, integration insights, and field learnings.
Drive internal and external product education, including enablement for System Integrators (SIs) and channel partners.
Maintain deep awareness of AI and CX industry trends, ensuring Aircall’s positioning remains competitive and insights continuously feed back into product and GTM strategies.

Why This Role is Unique

This is a role for builders, connectors, and enablers. You’ll be at the intersection of AI innovation, customer experience, and scalable delivery — combining technical curiosity with a consulting mindset. Every project you lead not only delivers value for customers but also strengthens Aircall’s internal capability to deploy AI faster and smarter.
