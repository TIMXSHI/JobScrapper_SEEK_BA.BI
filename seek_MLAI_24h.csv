The Opportunity

Project MAVERIC is a Monash-led initiative pioneering the next generation of AI-driven research infrastructure. Its mission is to accelerate discovery in addressing some of humanity's most pressing challenges, from combating disease to advancing environmental science. By uniting high-performance computing, large-scale data systems, and cutting-edge AI infrastructure, MAVERIC is redefining how researchers develop, train, and scale artificial intelligence to solve complex real-world problems. 

We are seeking Senior AI Research Computing Engineers to play a pivotal technical leadership role in bringing this vision to life. In this position, you will act as the critical link between ambitious research goals and the powerful computing systems that enable them. You will architect, implement, and support the distributed AI platforms that form the foundation of MAVERIC’s mission, empowering researchers to push the limits of generative AI, computational science, and cross-disciplinary innovation. 

This role suits someone who excels at the intersection of software engineering, high-performance computing, and applied artificial intelligence. You'll work very closely with researchers to translate and accelerate their research using AI, turning complex scientific challenges into breakthrough computational solutions.

Key Responsibilities

Partner with researchers across diverse domains (drug discovery, healthcare, computer vision, and beyond) to translate scientific goals into scalable AI/ML solutions
Architect and optimise sophisticated AI models for high performance computing (HPC) environments, implementing distributed training strategies and performance tuning at scale
Lead development of automated MLOps pipelines using containerisation, orchestration platforms, and CI/CD practices.
Benchmark, profile, and optimise AI applications across software and hardware layers to maximise GPU cluster efficiency
Build research community capability through expert consultation, training programs, and technical documentation.
Evaluate and apply emerging AI/ML technologies to novel research problems.

What We're Looking For

Extensive experience applying AI/ML techniques (deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning) to complex scientific problems
Expert Python programming with major ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch or equivalent)
Proven experience designing and deploying AI workflows on HPC/GPU systems, including distributed training frameworks
Linux system administration and HPC environment troubleshooting
Ability to collaborate with researchers from diverse disciplines and work independently with minimal supervision

Highly Regarded Skills/Experience

Postgraduate degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or related discipline with extensive relevant experience; OR equivalent combination of experience and education in AI/ML and research computing
MLOps experience: containerisation (Docker, Singularity), orchestration (Kubernetes, Slurm), CI/CD pipelines
Knowledge of GPU architecture, performance optimisation, and profiling tools
