We're seeking a Principal Engineer with a strong software engineering background who has successfully transitioned into the AI/ML space, specifically in the practical application of Agentic AI within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

This role is not about embedding GenAI into products - it's about redefining how software is built, tested, and delivered through AI-assisted development practices. You'll work closely with engineering and product teams to transform existing processes using agentic systems that automate, optimise, and accelerate delivery.

Key Responsibilities

Lead the implementation of Agentic AI frameworks across all stages of the SDLC - from product specification to development, testing, and deployment.
Partner with engineering, architecture, and product teams to identify opportunities for AI-assisted improvements in software delivery.
Design and oversee proofs of concept and production rollouts of AI-driven development processes.
Guide developers on integrating AI systems into their workflows while maintaining quality, compliance, and governance standards.
Influence technical and executive stakeholders on the strategic benefits of AI-assisted engineering.
Establish best practices, documentation, and technical patterns for ongoing adoption of Agentic AI.

Skills & Experience

Strong background in software engineering (e.g., Python, Java, Golang, TypeScript, or similar).
6+ months of commercial experience applying Agentic AI within the SDLC - not just product integration.
Proven experience designing or leading technical architecture related to automation, pipelines, or AI-assisted development.
Deep understanding of software delivery processes, CI/CD, version control, and modern development environments.
Excellent communication and influencing skills - capable of working with both development teams and executive leadership.
Familiarity with AI frameworks, agent orchestration, or LLM integration tools (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, etc.) is advantageous.


Ideal Candidate

You're an experienced software engineer or architect who understands how code is built, tested, and deployed - and you've now started reshaping that process through Agentic AI. You combine technical depth with strong communication, capable of translating AI innovation into tangible outcomes for development teams and senior leadership alike.

Looking to shape the future of software delivery with Agentic AI? Lead, innovate & grow as you transform the SDLC from the ground up - apply now!"

Curate targeted subsets of data using ML techniques including clustering, embedding-based similarity search, and automated quality scoring
Extract, visualize, and communicate actionable insights about dataset composition, distributions, biases, and statistical properties to inform research decisions
Build performant, parallel algorithms for gathering and processing data at scale, optimizing for both throughput and cost-efficiency across distributed systems
Engineer intuitive interfaces and tooling to help researchers explore, sample, and interact with large datasets without requiring deep infrastructure knowledge
Work with paired multimodal data (text-image, audio-video, etc.), ensuring alignment quality, handling synchronization challenges, and maintaining multimodal correspondence
Leverage high-performance parallel computing frameworks (Ray, Spark, torch.distributed, DeepSpeed, etc) and cloud infrastructure for distributed data operations on petabyte-scale datasets

You’re probably a match if you have:

A strong aesthetic sense, with a background or demonstrated passion for visual design or human-computer interaction.

Strong proficiency in Python and ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).

Extensive experience with designing and implementing large-scale data processing workflows using libraries like Pandas and data warehousing solutions such as Snowflake.

Solid understanding of statistical methods, including experimental design, A/B testing, and quality evaluation systems.

Experience with generative AI and synthetic data generation is highly desirable.
