We’re a Western Sydney-based company with over 20 years of validated market demand, building a cloud-native SaaS platform alongside an experienced external engineering partner.

This is not an idea-stage startup.

We have:

A highly engaged professional customer base

Deep industry credibility

Active MVP development underway

A clear roadmap toward scalable SaaS architecture and AI-enabled functionality

Now we’re already building our in-house technical function and we’re looking for a Founding Engineer to take architectural ownership of the platform and shape its long-term technical future.




The Opportunity

This is genuine founding-level ownership.

You will:

Architect and protect the SaaS platform layer

Establish scalable infrastructure foundations

Embed security and compliance by design

Prepare the platform for pilot, launch and scale

Work directly with founders and industry leaders

Help shape the future AI capability of the product

Build the internal engineering capability over time

You won’t inherit technical debt.
You won’t manage a bloated internal team.
You won’t sit between bureaucracy and product.

You will work alongside founders and directly alongside the professionals who will use the platform, building technology with real-world feedback from day one.




The Mandate

Your overarching objective:

Design and deliver a secure, scalable, AI-ready SaaS platform that is genuinely production-ready and built for long-term growth.




Core Responsibilities
1. SaaS Architecture & Platform Ownership

Own cloud-native infrastructure architecture across environments

Ensure multi-tenant SaaS scalability and reliability

Define standards for observability, resilience and performance

Maintain architectural consistency as the platform evolves

Collaborate with external engineering partners to ensure implementation aligns with defined customer journeys and product milestones

Confidently challenge architectural decisions to protect long-term integrity

2. Security & Compliance by Design

Operating in a professional services environment, confidentiality and data integrity are non-negotiable.

You will:

Design and enforce least-privilege access models

Ensure encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest (cloud-native KMS)

Establish vulnerability management processes

Coordinate independent penetration testing

Prioritise remediation and oversee re-testing

Embed secure development lifecycle practices

Define incident response and escalation procedures

Implement robust audit logging and traceability

Support compliance readiness (e.g., SOC 2)

Security will be built in, not retrofitted.




3. AI & Technological Advancement

While our MVP focuses on core SaaS functionality, our roadmap includes progressive integration of AI-enabled capabilities.

You will:

Ensure the platform architecture is AI-ready and extensible

Contribute to decisions around AI infrastructure, data strategy and model integration

Advise leadership on sequencing AI innovation responsibly and sustainably

Balance innovation with security, reliability and compliance

This is about building the foundation for future technological advancement, not bolting AI onto a fragile system.




4. Strategic Technical Leadership

You will act as the in-house technical authority:

Translating architectural trade-offs into business impact

Advising leadership on infrastructure sequencing and scale readiness

Shaping technical investment decisions

Influencing stakeholder relationships and timelines

Contributing to future internal hiring and team design




Who You Are

Outliers welcome.

You likely have:

5+ years in cloud engineering, platform, DevOps or backend roles

Experience owning production SaaS environments

A strong systems-thinking and security mindset

Confidence influencing external engineering teams

Curiosity about AI and emerging technologies

Comfort operating at both architectural and strategic levels

You value building things properly from the outset, not just shipping features.




What Makes This Different

Founding-level ownership without startup chaos

Validated demand and engaged industry users

Direct access to industry leaders shaping the product

Real-world feedback loop from professionals who will use the platform

AI-forward roadmap with long-term vision

Western Sydney location without CBD commute pressure

Opportunity to build your own internal engineering team over time




Quick Apply

As part of your application, please briefly outline:

How you have influenced external engineering delivery

How you assess whether infrastructure is genuinely production-ready
