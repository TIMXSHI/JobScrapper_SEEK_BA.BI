For some 30 years, our Sydney-based firm has delivered trusted mortgage and credit solutions to Australian clients. With 15 dedicated professionals and a focus on innovation, we combine decades of expertise with cutting-edge technology

We've spent decades deep in Australian lending. Now we're building RobinAI – a scenario engine that lets brokers test real loan applications against real lender rules and get answers they can trust. We're looking for one exceptional early-career engineer to help build the brain of this system. You'll work directly with a Principal Engineer and a Senior Credit Manager, on real applied AI, decisioning, and financial systems used by brokers every day. This is a fast-track role: big ownership, proper mentoring, and clear upside as you prove impact what you'll do.


Model how credit works

We've deep in Australian lending. Now we're building RobinAI – a scenario engine that lets brokers test real deal applications against real lender rules and get answers they can trust.

The Role:

We’re seeking a motivated, detail-oriented graduate in Manila/Philippines to join our team. This role is your launchpad to becoming a Senior AI Engineer within 2-3 years, with a clear pathway to double your current salary in this timeframe.

Role: Graduate AI Engineer (Backend + LLM) – RobinAI @ Brokerpedia
Company: Brokerpedia
Location: Remote (AU-friendly) / Sydney
Type: Full-time · Early Career (0–2 years)


We're looking for one exceptional early-career engineer to help build the brain of this system.

An AI/ML specific degree is required for this Graduate AI Engineer position.

You'll work directly with a Principal Engineer and a Senior Credit Manager, on real applied AI, decisioning, and financial systems used by brokers every day. This is a fast-track role: big ownership, proper mentoring, and clear upside as you prove impact what you'll do.

Proficiency in multiple specific programming languages is essential for this backend and LLM engineering role.

Model how credit works

Help define RobinAI's structured ""credit language"": things like LVR, LMI, land size, FHB schemes, non-residents, trusts, income types, cash out, security types.

Implement combinations of concepts that signal real scenarios (e.g. large land + LMI, FHB scheme + LVR + price).

Build the scenario engine

Turn messy, natural-language questions from brokers into clean, structured facts.

Help design and maintain a simple, robust lender rules model.

Help build the scoring & ranking engine that compares scenarios across lenders and explains which ones fit, which don't, and why—in plain English.

Wire it into LLMs (safely)

Feed structured rules and scenario data into OpenAI-style models.

Help craft prompts so RobinAI behaves like a careful senior credit analyst:

grounded in real policy,

clear on assumptions,

always ""based on policy, subject to assessment""—never promising approvals.

Make it measurable & production-grade

Add logging so every answer is explainable and debuggable.

Help design simple evaluations: which scenarios we're getting right, where models drift, what to fix.

Write tests for high-impact cases (rural properties, FHB schemes, non-resident deals, trusts, cash out).

Who you are

Graduate of a top university (e.g., University of the Philippines, Ateneo de Manila, De La Salle University, or equivalent; preferably Cum Laude/Magna Cum Laude) in AI/Data Science/Computer Science or a related field is preferred.

Experience with C# and .NET Core 8.x,.

Comfortable with:

APIs and data models,

writing and testing clean code,

reading specs and turning them into logic.

Good with stats & numbers:

you're happy thinking in probabilities,

you can sanity-check metrics,

and you're comfortable evaluating whether a model or rule ""looks right"" from data.

You've built something non-trivial (project, internship, open source, serious uni work) and can explain how you designed it.

You care about:

correctness and edge cases,

safety and explainability,

using AI in a disciplined way, not as a gimmick.

You want a steep learning curve: real ownership, real users, senior people to learn from, and the chance to grow your compensation and responsibility quickly as you prove what you can do.

What you get

Competitive graduate package with room to move fast as you deliver.

Direct pairing with:

a Principal Engineer (architecture, code quality, career growth),

a Senior Credit/Policy Lead (how real lending decisions work).

A front-row seat to:

applied AI in a high-trust domain,

building a decisioning product from the inside,

shipping visible features, not sitting in the shadows.

Why Join Us?

Salary & growth

PHP 50,000–100,000/month (depending on experience) + 13th month pay.

Clear upside: as you take on more ownership across the Scenario Engine and LLM stack, there’s a genuine path toward Senior Scenario/AI Engineer-level compensation for top performers.

Industry-best environment

Elite mentorship – Work directly with a Principal Engineer and a Senior Credit/Policy Lead who’ve built real products in lending and AI. This is a deliberate fast-track role, not a generic grad rotation.

Cutting-edge tech – Hands-on with:

OpenAI/LLM ecosystems

search & retrieval

decision/rules engines

modern backend stack (APIs, data models, cloud).

Serious problems, real impact – You’re helping design how AI is safely used in a high-trust, regulated domain. This is portfolio-defining work that actually ships.

Accelerated career path

High performers can quickly grow into Senior Scenario/AI Engineer responsibilities:

owning core components,

influencing AI and product decisions,

mentoring future hires.

The skills you build (AI + rules + lending) are globally relevant: transferable to markets like the UK, US, and other financial domains.

Perks

Permanent remote (AU-friendly hours), with occasional trips to Sydney for deep-dive working sessions.

Annual international resort offsite – an overseas team trip with a plus one included, to connect, reset, and celebrate what you’ve shipped.

Small, close-knit, low-politics team – direct access to founders, fast decisions, real responsibility, and a culture built on curiosity, ownership, and actually delivering.

Voxworks is an Australian AI company building the future of human–machine conversation.

Our mission is simple: make talking to AI feel as natural as talking to a person.

We believe AI voice is the new interface for business-to-customer interactions, and we’re building the core infrastructure to support our Australian corporate and SME clients on their journey to automate sales, support, customer engagement, and retention calls.

We’re a lean, engineering-led team that ships fast and builds applications that have real-world impact across multiple industries. Our stack spans Next.js / React / Typescript frontend, Node.js + Postgres backend, AI agents in Python, SIP trunking, and proprietary voice pipelines that orchestrate the world’s cutting edge AI models.

About the role

We’re looking for Senior Engineers who are equally comfortable writing clean production code and designing distributed systems.

You’ll work directly with the founders to build, scale, and automate the Voxworks platform, from backend APIs and database architecture to AI voice agent orchestration and deployment pipelines.

This is not a maintenance job. You’ll be helping shape an entire AI infrastructure company from the ground up.

Candidates must have Australian permanent residency or citizenship to be eligible for this position.

Skills:

Any or all of the below are relevant:

Core software development: Node.js, React, Next.js, Python, AWS, CI/CD, Git, SQL, HTTP, Websockets, CSS, DevOps, Linux, Grafana/Prometheus/Loki

AI development: AI data pipelines in Python, LLM APIs, evals, self-hosting, LLM inference frameworks, RAG, vector embeddings, model finetuning, prompt engineering

Why This Company

We’re at the start of a new shift. Every business that relies on phone interactions can now have an AI voice agent of their dreams. But companies aren't ready and robots don't build themselves.

At Voxworks, we're building the new standard for building AI voice agents. A seamless UI, a comprehensive toolkit, effortless integrations. We're creating everything Australian businesses need to deliver exceptional phone interactions on every single call. Our stack is designed to be used across all company sizes from SMB to enterprise, and across almost every industry vertical.

Why This Role

Build cutting-edge AI systems with real-world impact.

Small, elite team where every line of code moves the business forward.

Full visibility into the company roadmap, client growth, and technical decisions.

Shape engineering culture and process: code quality, reviews, CI/CD, observability, and security.

Experiment and integrate with cutting-edge AI models (LLMs, STT, TTS, embeddings, inference optimization).

Equity participation in a company with massive upside.

Work with founders who are senior level engineers and executives on a mission to grow quickly.

This is a high-impact role for engineers who want to take ownership and help build a category-defining product from the earliest days. As a Senior Software Engineer, you will craft features and shape the core systems and experiences that power millions of automated conversations.

You’ll work across the stack, solving tough technical challenges in real-time audio, global telephony, and developer tooling. You’ll collaborate closely with the founding team, talk to customers, and ship improvements weekly.

If you’re excited by big problems, fast feedback loops, and the opportunity to help define how businesses use voice AI at scale, let’s talk.

Who You Are

Full Stack Pro – You’ve got 3+ years of experience building production-grade apps. You bring clean design and systems thinking and care about building both quickly and correctly. You are comfortable shipping anywhere across the stack and can pick up new frameworks extremely quickly.

Technically Grounded – You hold a degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or equivalent practical experience and you’ve used it to build real things that people use.

Quick, Curious, & Collaborative – You thrive in fast-moving environments, learn new tools and frameworks quickly, and enjoy working across teams to get things done.

Startup-Ready – You’re familiar with cloud stacks and love the chaos and clarity of small teams. Startup experience is a plus, but a scrappy, adaptable mindset is essential.

What You’ll Do

Build the Core Experience – Design and build mission-critical features of our AI voice platform including prompt management, test tooling, dashboards, analytics, and more. You’ll bring UI to life with modern design and beautiful UI in the modern style of Notion, Linear, etc.

Work Across the Stack – From backend APIs to polished UIs to DevOps workflows. You’ll build systems that power millions of calls and scale with a growing customer base.

Own Big Projects – Take engineering projects from concept to launch. Leading technical architecture, coding, deployment, and iteration.

Craft Great UX – Collaborate with designers, PMs, and other engineers to create fast, intuitive, and beautiful intuitive user experiences.

Partner With Customers – Work directly with users to support onboarding, debug tough issues, and turn feedback into features that drive trust and long-term success."
