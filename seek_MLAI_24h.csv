Job description:



The primary objective of this critical role is to accelerate AI adoption at Australian Unity by leading end-to-end AI initiatives within the People & Culture (P&C) Business.

End-to-end ownership of AI adoption within a business platform squad, from identifying opportunities, facilitating prioritisation and planning, solution selection, design and delivery, managing user uptake and value realisation, and supporting solutions post-deployment.
Deliver AI initiatives that build user confidence, simplify adoption, and realise tangible business value.
Ensure end-to-end delivery of AI projects—primarily leveraging vendor-provided solutions and low-code platforms—by aligning with Australian Unity's AI Governance Procedures and actively collaborating with cross-functional teams and stakeholders.
Apply AI governance frameworks, guardrails, and risk/compliance standards consistently across project design and delivery.
Ensure all solutions are robust, well-documented, and aligned with enterprise standards
Provide specialist expertise, define enterprise-level AI frameworks / target state architecture in at least one of AI literacy & change management, AI governance or AIOps process optimization

About You:

To be successful in the role you will be able to demonstrate the following capabilities / experience:

Degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Science, Business, or other fields relevant to the role
Substantial professional experience (5+ years), including demonstrated success in consulting, business-facing, or technology enablement roles. Experience within industries such as health, insurance, banking, or wealth & capital markets is desirable.
Demonstrated experience in technology solution enablement — including opportunity identification, vendor onboarding, low-code prototyping, solution design, delivery coordination, and change adoption.
Strong communication skills and able to tailor complex AI/ML concenpts for non-technical audiences and influence decisions across business and technology.
Exposure to or contribution towards initiatives in one or more areas of AI Literacy & Change Management, AIOps / MLOps / LLMOp
Hands-on experience with low-code and automation platforms e.g., Microsoft Power Automate, Copilot Studio (desirable)
