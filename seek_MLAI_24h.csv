In the Acquisition, Engagement & Retention Crew, you will help lead the Group’s flagship Merchant Modernisation initiatives, creating intelligent, automated and deeply personalised experiences that redefine how merchants and customers connect.

As a Staff Software Engineer, you will blend strategic vision with hands-on technical leadership across a modern .NET and Next.js stack driving AI powered engineering expertise. You will architect and deliver high-quality, scalable and secure systems while guiding teams through complex challenges and pushing the boundaries of what is possible with AI driven engineering capabilities.

Our Crew is in the process of delivering breakthroughs in smart onboarding, dynamic engagement and data-led automation. The future is even more exciting, with next generation acquisition journeys, hyper personalised digital experiences and platform foundations engineered for intelligence, reliability and speed.

This is a place where your expertise truly matters. A place to design, build, challenge and run products that make a real impact. A place filled with people who care deeply about craft, innovation and shaping what comes next.




See yourself in our team:  

Imagine being part of the technology organisation that powers the digital heartbeat of Australia. At CBA, we deliver world-class digital banking, leading data and analytics capabilities, and state-of-the-art workplace technology for over 53,000 people. Everything we build helps our teams work smarter and empowers millions of customers with secure, seamless and innovative experiences.

Within this ecosystem, the Acquisition, Engagement & Retention Crew plays a vital role in the Everyday Business Banking Domain. We support critical payment services that underpin 40% of Australia’s economy and enable more than $90 billion in daily transactions. From merchant acquiring and terminal tech to high-value international payments, our systems must be reliable, scalable and constantly evolving to meet the needs of businesses across the nation.

As a Staff Software Engineer, you will be a technical expert shaping technical strategy and designing solutions for complex engineering challenges. You will lead by example with a security-first mindset, elevate engineering craft across the team and drive innovation through AI powered engineering, cloud technologies and high-performance platforms.

If you are energised by purpose, inspired by scale and passionate about building technology that truly matters, you will feel right at home in our team.




We’re interested in hearing from people who: 

Act as technical SMEs and engineering leaders, shaping long-term technical strategy while remaining deeply hands-on, building robust, scalable, cloud-native solutions using .NET/.NET Core, C#, Next.js, React, TypeScript, and AWS.

Engineer modern, AI-augmented full-stack experiences, delivering intuitive UIs, high-performance BFF microservices (GraphQL/REST), and automated data access layers that unlock real business value.

Are passionate about designing, developing, and deploying high-quality software solutions, contributing to end-to-end design and implementation while influencing the technical evolution of the platform.

Leverage cutting-edge AI development tools such as GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Cline, Figma AI, and emerging ML services to accelerate delivery, uplift code quality, and pioneer AI-driven engineering practices.

Design and evolve platform architecture, influencing microservices patterns, event-driven integrations, and cloud-native deployments while championing engineering standards and best practices across teams.

Lead high-quality delivery through world-class engineering practices, spanning CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions, Artifactory), test automation (TDD/BDD), observability (CloudWatch, Grafana, Splunk), and DevSecOps.

Continuously innovate and automate, using Python/PowerShell scripting, AWS tooling, and deep troubleshooting expertise to improve performance, eliminate friction, and push the boundaries of what's technically possible.




Tech skills 

We use a broad range of tools, languages, and frameworks. We don’t expect you to possess knowledge of all, but experience or exposure with some, or their equivalents, will set you up for success in this team:

Front-End & Back-End Languages: Deep technical capability across C#, .NET – essential, TypeScript, React and or Next.js, and building cloud-native microservices on AWS.

AI/ML & GenAI Tooling: Practical hands-on experience with LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, and strong working knowledge of RAG and Agentic AI system design essential

AI Coding Assistants: Daily power-user of GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Continue, Aider, Cline, and modern AI developer tooling to accelerate engineering workflows.

Cloud, Infra & DevOps: Strong understanding of, Docker containers, cloud-based architectures, and CI/CD using Guithub Action, with automated testing and governance integrated.

Quality Engineering & Automation: Deep expertise in test automation frameworks, Selenium, Appium, LeanFT, TDD/BDD, service virtualization, and enterprise-scale QA patterns supporting CI/CD & DevOps.

Agile Delivery & Tooling: Proven experience delivering in Agile/Scrum, using JIRA, Confluence, GitHub, and driving effective engineering practices and test strategies across teams."
