• You’ll collaborate with AI researchers to translate novel techniques into deployable video tools
• You’ll contribute to scalable ML infrastructure and model serving and experimentational frameworks
• You’ll participate in roadmap discussions, engineering reviews, and planning cycles
• You’ll be hands-on with model evaluation, optimization, and continuous improvements

What we're looking for

• Experience deploying ML models into production, ideally for video, vision, or generative applications
• Proficiency in Python and deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, Torch)
• Strong systems knowledge, including working with inference pipelines and performance optimization
• Familiarity with ML lifecycle tooling—experiment tracking, monitoring, deployment
• Collaborative approach and ability to work across product, research, and infrastructure teams
• A user-focused mindset and drive to create magical experiences powered by ML
