MotorPlatform is Australia’s fastest-growing B2B automotive marketplace and SaaS platform.

The core platform is built. The next phase is the hard, high-leverage work: scaling product, scaling engineering, and scaling operational excellence, while we shift to being AI-first in how we build and how the platform creates value.

The role

We’re hiring a Senior Full-Stack Engineer to act as Deputy Lead / 2IC in engineering. You’ll be a hands-on builder who can take ownership of major initiatives, lead projects end-to-end, and keep delivery moving with clarity and discipline.

Onsite in Sydney. We want fast feedback loops, high collaboration, and strong product-engineering alignment.

What you’ll be doing (this is a scale role, not a “greenfield” role)

You’ll work on the problems that show up when something is already working and growing fast:

Scale system performance, reliability, and developer velocity as usage expands

Harden security, privacy, observability, and operational runbooks

Build new marketplace capabilities that unlock liquidity, speed, and better dealer outcomes

Reduce friction in critical workflows and improve conversion through product-led engineering

Lead projects that cut across web, mobile, backend, and infrastructure

Improve delivery predictability through planning, coordination, and proactive risk management

Mentor engineers and set the bar for pragmatic, high-quality execution

AI-first: what we expect from you

We’re becoming an AI-first business. That means AI isn’t an experiment on the side—it’s part of the operating system.

You’ll help embed AI into:

Product: smarter workflows, better matching, better quality control, dealer-facing efficiency

Operations: internal tools, automation, knowledge capture, faster support and triage

Engineering: AI-assisted development, testing acceleration, improved reviews, quicker iteration

You’ll partner with our AI/BI team to embed intelligence into the platform and marketplace, including:

Integrating valuation engines into core workflows (pricing, buying, selling, approvals)

Shipping analytics and insights (vehicle acquisition and disposal performance, liquidity signals, margin drivers)

Productionising data/AI services: API contracts, monitoring, quality checks, fallbacks, latency and cost controls

Building internal tools for faster decisions (dashboards, alerts, workflow automation)

You don’t need an ML background. You do need to be comfortable shipping AI-enabled features responsibly and using AI to increase leverage.

Tech stack

Web: React

Mobile: React Native

Backend: PHP (Laravel & Vapor) + Node/TypeScript where it fits

Database: Postgres

Cloud: AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda)

Delivery: CI/CD, testing, modern development practices

What we’re looking for

Must-haves

Min 6+ years full-stack engineering experience in production

Strong PHP/Laravel (non-negotiable)

Strong React; React Native strongly valued

Strong Postgres fundamentals (schema, migrations, optimisation)

AWS experience (EC2/RDS/S3/Lambda)

Track record leading delivery end-to-end and operating as a senior owner

Highly organised, proactive, and quick to absorb product + industry context

Wants to work onsite in Sydney (Lane Cove)

Nice-to-haves

Marketplace / high-growth SaaS scaling experience

AI-enabled feature delivery (LLM APIs, retrieval/search, automation)

IaC (Terraform/CloudFormation)

Testing frameworks (PHPUnit/Pest, Jest/Mocha)

Why this is a strong next step

The platform is real and growing and your work immediately compounds

You’ll have leadership scope without being removed from building

You’ll help shape how we scale and how we embed AI into the business

You’ll work closely with Product and influence what gets built and why

We exist to double healthcare’s capacity while keeping care deeply human. In 18 months, Heidi has returned more than 18 million hours to clinicians and supported over 73 million patient visits. Today, more than two million patient visits each week are powered by Heidi across 116 countries and over 110 languages.

Founded by clinicians, Heidi brings together clinicians, engineers, designers, scientists, creatives, and mathematicians, working with a shared purpose: to strengthen the human connection at the heart of healthcare.

Backed by nearly $100 million in total funding, Heidi is expanding across the USA, UK, Canada, and Europe, partnering with major health systems including the NHS, Beth Israel Lahey Health, MaineGeneral, and Monash Health, among others.

We move quickly where it matters and stay grounded in what’s proven, shaping healthcare’s next era. Ready for the challenge?




What you’ll do:

Architect and build backend services that power LLM-based agents and clinical automations.

Design robust APIs & data models that are secure, observable and easy for other teams to extend.

Optimise performance and cost—profile hot paths, tune databases and right-size cloud resources.

Automate quality: write unit / integration tests, craft alerts and own on-call runbooks so clinicians can trust every interaction.

Partner with product, design and other engineers to ship new capabilities from concept to production in weeks, not quarters.


What we will look for:

Mastery of Fullstack fundamentals: You are equally proficient in Python and modern frontend frameworks (React/TypeScript), capable of owning a feature from the database schema to the UI interaction.

Applied AI & Voice fluency: You have a working knowledge of LLM integration (RAG, prompt engineering) and audio technologies (ASR, speech processing) and know how to build around their probabilistic nature.

Pragmatic problem solving: You balance engineering purity with the need for speed; you know when to build a robust system and when to ship a tactical solution to unblock a customer.

Cloud fluency (AWS or GCP): You can spin up your own infrastructure (containers, serverless functions) and manage CI/CD pipelines to get your code into the hands of users independently.

Rigorous testing in production: You understand that ""works on my machine"" isn't enough; you implement observability and feedback loops to monitor how your AI features perform in the wild.




What do we believe in?

Heidi builds for the future of healthcare, not just the next quarter, and our goals are ambitious because the world’s health demands it. We believe in progress built through precision, pace, and ownership.

Live Forever - Every release moves care forward: measured, safe, and built to last. Data guides us, but patients define the truth that matters.

Practice Ownership - Decisions follow logic and proof, not hierarchy. Exceptional care demands exceptional standards in our work, our thinking, and our character.

Small Cuts Heal Faster - Stability earns trust, speed delivers impact. Progress is about learning fast without breaking what people depend on.

Make others better - Feedback is direct, kindness is constant, and excellence lifts everyone. Our success is measured by collective growth, not individual output.

Our mission is clear: expand the world’s capacity to care, and do it without losing the humanity that makes care worth delivering.




Why you will flourish with us?

Flexible work with a 50% hybrid environment

Additional paid day off for your birthday and wellness days

A generous personal development budget of $500 per annum

Learn from some of the best engineers and creatives, joining a diverse team

Become an owner, with shares (equity) in the company, if Heidi  wins, we all win

The rare chance to create a global impact as you immerse yourself in one of Australia’s leading healthtech startups 

If you have an impact quickly, the opportunity to fast track your startup career!"
