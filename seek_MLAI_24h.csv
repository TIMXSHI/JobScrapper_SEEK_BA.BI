Our Team

From take-off to landing, Thales offers the most complete range of solutions to provide dynamic Air Traffic Services to support today's growing domestic and international travel requirements. Utilising this knowledge and experience

Thales Australia will deliver a harmonised Civil/Military Air Traffic Management System (OneSKY) in Australia to Airservices Australia and Defence. 

This will enable a new level of safety and efficiency, while also reducing delays for the travelling public and providing opportunities to improve environmental outcomes. OneSKY will transform Australia’s sky and we are proud to be partners in its delivery.

Your role:

The Senior Systems Integrator must ensure that systems and sub-system components are successfully integrated on time according to the project schedule, managing the setup of environments for integration, testing, and acceptance activities.

We’re searching for an expert in integration within Air Traffic Management systems to join our TopSky-ATC(HE) team, delivering on projects for our customers across the APAC region.

Key responsibilities:

Identifying and capturing system integration issues or risks early is crucial to ensure timely resolution by the wider engineering teams. This involves analyzing system/subsystem technical and functional issues, logging them according to internal processes, and collaborating with various teams to address these issues
Conducting the successful integration and testing of incremental software releases, defining and contributing to testing activities across multiple platforms (regression, interface, simulation scenarios), and managing test and measuring tools for system performance assessment are key responsibilities
The Senior Integration Engineer must output documentation and engineering artefacts that comply with functional, performance, robustness, security, and quality standards, aligned with internal configuration management processes. Additionally, promoting knowledge sharing to ensure work is captured sufficiently for re-use across projects is essential
The role involves supporting and providing guidance to junior integrators and other technical teams (such as Systems Engineering, Software Engineering, and Verification & Validation) on integration, technical, and configuration issues. This includes reviewing documentation and providing expert technical support

One day one you will come with:

5 years+ experience holding similar positions integrating complex software-centric real-time systems (Air Traffic Management – mandatory)
Site software integration deployment / support experience
Knowledge of networks and network configuration / exposure to distributed systems
Work experience in integrating large projects, preferably ATC-related (Military or Civilian).
