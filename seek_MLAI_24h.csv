AI-powered Automation COO | Commonwealth Bank


If you're inspired by the potential of AI and excited to shape the future of intelligent operations, this is your opportunity to make a meaningful impact. Together, we'll advance LLM and ML-powered automation across the COO.

Your Impact:

Join CommBank's pioneering AI-powered Automation COO Crew, a cross-functional team embedded in CTO and aligned with COO priorities. We're building secure, scalable, and intelligent automation solutions using LLMs and machine learning to solve real operational pain points-from customer offboarding to document triage and home loan discharge.

As Senior Manager - AI Strategy and Metrics, you'll lead the strategic and analytical backbone of this transformation. Your work will define how we measure success, guide investment, and ensure every AI solution delivers tangible business value.

You'll work closely with the Crew Lead and Distinguished Engineer to ensure strategy and metrics are grounded in technical excellence and aligned with enterprise engineering standards.

What You'll Do:


Design and Optimise AI Metrics: Lead the development and continuous improvement of performance metrics for LLM and ML-powered agents operating in production. This includes tracking both quantity (e.g. number of agents deployed, cases handled) and quantitative impact (e.g. turnaround time, error reduction, cost efficiency).

Strategic Recommendations: Provide high-level strategic and metrics recommendations to guide the evolution of AI-powered automation across COO domains.

Partner with COO Stakeholders: Collaborate closely with business leaders across the COO to ensure automation metrics and strategy are aligned with operational priorities and transformation goals.

Shape the Strategy: Define and evolve the AI roadmap for automation, ensuring alignment with enterprise platforms and engineering standards.

Measure What Matters: Establish performance frameworks to track impact across speed, accuracy, resilience, and business value.

Drive Data-Driven Decisions: Use real-world data to inform experimentation, benchmark impact, and guide prioritisation.

Lead Governance & Alignment: Coordinate quarterly steering reviews with CTO and COO stakeholders, ensuring transparency and strategic alignment.

Support Investment Cases: Quantify the value of AI-powered automation and support funding decisions with clear, data-backed outcomes.

Promote Visibility: Elevate the strategy through executive dashboards, showcases, and reporting that inspire and inform.

What You'll Measure:

You'll help shape and optimise high-level metrics across four key dimensions:


Observability & Operational Health: Monitor system uptime, integration stability, and performance indicators to ensure resilient and available AI agents.

AI Performance & Quality: Track accuracy, usefulness, and failure patterns using a blend of automated and human-in-the-loop evaluations.

Business Efficiency & Cost Impact: Quantify turnaround time improvements, cost per case, and scalability benefits to demonstrate ROI.

Strategic Value & Resilience: Measure adaptability, SLA adherence, and operational coverage to position AI as a long-term enabler for growth.

What You Bring:


Proven experience in AI strategy, analytics, or performance management in large-scale tech or operations environments.

Strong understanding of LLMs, ML Ops, and intelligent automation principles.

Ability to translate technical outcomes into business value for senior stakeholders.

Experience leading cross-functional initiatives across product, engineering, and business teams.

Familiarity with Agile delivery, experimentation models, and continuous improvement.

Exceptional communication and storytelling skills, with a track record of executive-level influence.

Why Join Us:

At CommBank, we're not just adopting AI-we're redefining how operations work. You'll be part of a high-impact crew that acts as a force-multiplier for operations, with the backing of CTO and COO leadership. Our mission is bold, our roadmap is clear, and our impact is measurable.

We celebrate diversity, encourage bold thinking, and support flexible working. If you're excited by this opportunity but don't tick every box, we still want to hear from you.


Whether you're passionate about customer service, driven by data, or called by creativity, a career here is for you.

Our people bring their diverse backgrounds and unique perspectives to build a respectful, inclusive and flexible workplace. We are working hard to build a team of people who represent the rich diversity of our customers and communities. If you're excited about this opportunity but you don't meet every single requirement, or your experience doesn't align perfectly, we still want to encourage you to apply. You may just be the perfect candidate for this opportunity or another within CommBank.

At CommBank we will inspire you with work that makes a difference, surround you with talented people that respect and value each other, and empower you to grow professionally and personally. Most of all, making a positive impact for customers, communities and each other is part of our every day.

We're determined to make a real difference for Australia's first peoples. We encourage all interested applicants to apply.

Familiarity with protocols and standards in the traffic and transport domain (SCATS, NEMA TS2, ITS, CAN, Ethernet, Modbus, RS-485).

Hands-on experience with real-time simulation, and fault injection for validation of safety systems.

Contribution to safety case documentation and engagement with external certification authorities/auditors.

Demonstrated ability to integrate embedded Linux (desirable) for communications/ UI while keeping safety functions isolated on RT cores/ MCUs.

Desirable:

Experience with traffic control algorithms, conflict detection, phase timing, and intergreen intervals.

Experience in secure boot, OTA update frameworks (RAUC/OSTree), and cybersecurity for embedded systems.

Exposure to Yocto/Buildroot, RTOS (Micrium, FreeRTOS), or dual-core MCU + Linux SoC designs.

Prior work in roadside, rail, transport systems or medical fields with harsh environment constraints.
