Develop and execute debug code to verify designs/ customer requirements.

Implement and maintain communication protocols (SCATS, NEMA TS2, ITS standards, CAN, Ethernet) for roadside devices and central system integration.

Develop web-based interfaces for local and remote-control functionality.

Ensure robust secure communications, OTA firmware updates, and diagnostics for long-term field deployments.

Participate in safety case documentation: hazard analysis, FMEA/FMELA, traceability, and compliance with certification bodies.

Mentor junior software engineers and perform peer reviews of designs and code.

Produce design, architecture, verification, validation and software release documentation.

What we look for:

Essential:

Proven experience (10 years+) developing embedded software for SIL2 (or higher) safety-critical systems, preferably in transportation, rail, or industrial control.

Strong C programming skills for MCUs and real-time operating systems, with demonstrable ability implementing algorithms and debugging hardware/ software interactions using oscilloscopes, logic analysers, and bus analysers.

Deep understanding of digital electronics and I/O design, including watchdogs, fail-safe states, redundancy, and EMC considerations.

Familiarity with protocols and standards in the traffic and transport domain (SCATS, NEMA TS2, ITS, CAN, Ethernet, Modbus, RS-485).

Hands-on experience with real-time simulation, and fault injection for validation of safety systems.

Contribution to safety case documentation and engagement with external certification authorities/auditors.

Demonstrated ability to integrate embedded Linux (desirable) for communications/ UI while keeping safety functions isolated on RT cores/ MCUs.

Desirable:

Experience with traffic control algorithms, conflict detection, phase timing, and intergreen intervals.

Experience in secure boot, OTA update frameworks (RAUC/OSTree), and cybersecurity for embedded systems.

Exposure to Yocto/Buildroot, RTOS (Micrium, FreeRTOS), or dual-core MCU + Linux SoC designs.

Prior work in roadside, rail, transport systems or medical fields with harsh environment constraints.

Only those candidates the Company (recruitment Agency Company) introduces to JCI by resumes on JCI’s Talent Acquisitions team’s explicit request will be deemed a candidate referred by the Company.
