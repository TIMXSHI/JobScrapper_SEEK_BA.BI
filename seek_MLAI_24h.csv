You will join the Data Science Section, a high-calibre team of data scientists, analysts, and engineers, led by a new EL2 driving enduring, customer-focused AI and data products.
 
The team is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, deploying platforms such as Gemini, Azure AI Foundry, Vortex AI, Hugging Face, PyTorch, llama-cpp, DSPy, and Unsloth.
 
The Opportunity

This is a chance to join a team at the forefront of AI experimentation within government.
 
You will have the opportunity to work hands-on building and testing proof-of-concept AI solutions, helping shape how the team transitions those capabilities into production delivery next financial year.
 
The team is operating in a start-small, prove-it, then scale model, experimenting across cloud and generative AI platforms while establishing the foundations for enduring products. Work currently underway or in the pipeline includes:

NLP-driven automation to replace manual processes across forms, documents, and workflows
Advanced analytics and modelling (including clustering, NLP, and digital twins) to understand sentiment, behaviour, and policy impacts
Applied generative AI, including pilots for image and video creation that have already demonstrated value
The Role

You will work as part of a multidisciplinary team delivering data science, AI, and cloud engineering solutions from concept through to early delivery.

Key responsibilities include:

Designing, engineering, and deploying data science and AI solutions in collaboration with data, digital, and business teams
Architecting and building cloud infrastructure (Azure, AWS or GCP) using Infrastructure as Code, with flexibility in how environments are set up
Delivering projects spanning data ingestion, ETL pipelines, exploratory analysis, NLP, generative AI, and self-service solutions
Rapidly prototyping engineering solutions for high-priority AI and data initiatives at proof-of-concept stage 
The Ideal Person

This role is deliberately broad and will suit one of two profiles. You may be a strong data engineer moving into AI, or an AI specialist with a solid data and engineering foundation. In both cases, you enjoy working hands-on in early-stage environments and helping teams move from experimentation to delivery.

This role will appeal to someone who enjoys filling gaps, complementing existing team capability, and contributing as an active delivery team member rather than operating as a standalone expert. Curiosity, comfort with ambiguity, and a willingness to research and test emerging technologies are essential.

Key skills and experience

Hands-on capability across Python, data pipelines, modelling or NLP, with the ability to work across both structured and unstructured data
Designing or working with cloud environments (Azure, AWS or GCP), ideally using Infrastructure as Code to enable flexible, scalable setups
Practical exposure to generative AI, including prototyping, prompt engineering, model evaluation, or working with open-weight models

Strong communication skills, with the ability to translate business problems into technical solutions and explain value to non-technical stakeholders
Salary / Rate

This is a full-time contract commencing in March for an initial contract through to 30/6/26. There is the possibility of a 12-month extension.

Build and operate production-grade AI infrastructure that operators trust and the business depends on.

We compete on speed and quality. We’re building production AI systems that dramatically reduce turnaround times while maintaining our design excellence, the goal is to streamline and push the limits of what’s possible.

The Role

Define together with the company stakeholders  how a large organisation adopts AI, then build the frameworks that make it happen independently.

You’ll create the playbooks, blueprints, and self-service processes that let department managers identify, scope, and implement AI workflows .

This is strategic architecture with immediate execution. You shape the vision, then you ship it.

Success metrics: Departments use your playbooks independently - Future projects deploy using your templates - Demonstrated time savings and team adoption within first 3 months

Must Have

•          Designed solutions bridging business strategy and technical execution

•          Created frameworks that enabled organisational independence (not dependency)

•          Worked directly with stakeholders and managers on transformation initiatives

•          Built playbooks, templates, or systems others could use without you

•          Comfortable with tight scope control and explicit criteria

Nice to Have

•          Experience transforming non-tech industries through AI

•          Background in events, logistics, design, or creative production

•          Worked in owner-operated businesses

•          Deployed AI in resource-constrained environments

•          Built adoption frameworks with measurable ROI

About You

You are: - A systems thinker who ships production solutions, not theoretical diagrams - Energized by creating leverage through frameworks - Comfortable measuring success by adoption rates and time savings

Reality check: - This is an established company, not a startup - Architecture flows through a single point of authority - Regular leadership review with CEO/CFO - Trust earned through conservative rollouts and proven value - Priorities can shift based on business needs
