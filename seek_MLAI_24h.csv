About the Role

We are looking for versatile engineers with real-world experience in machine control systems, especially industrial software platforms like Siemens, Rockwell, Phoenix and others.

The role has a fantastic amount of variety both in the technologies you'll deal with and the applications you'll encounter. Our wide cross-section of customers will provide you with opportunity to learn about many different industrial manufacturing processes for everything from food and beverage to steel tube forming, timber milling to concrete batching, textile weaving to material packaging, standalone machines to entire lines.

You will play a vital role across all stages of the job lifecycle. A typical week will consist of a mix of project work (typically 1-3 projects running concurrently), an occasional spot of troubleshooting for a breakdown at a customer site, some time assisting other team members, and always honing your skills through regular professional development and learning.

On average approximately half of your time will be spent in the office on system design and program preparation, and half out on sites commissioning and tuning your systems. Some working-from-home is available, and a small amount of regional and interstate travel is involved from time to time.

Supported by great colleagues you will carry out tasks such as:

Scoping and investigating requirements for new projects,

Advising and guiding customers in their choice of technologies and system architectures.

Designing, developing and commissioning PLC code and HMI interfaces

Programming inverters for induction motors and servo drive motion controls

Creating execution sequences for pneumatic and hydraulic actuators

Implementing safety access controls and interlocks

Industrial networking (both TCP/IP and serial-based field buses)

Planning and monitoring project phases

Mentoring less experienced staff

Providing advice to installation teams,

Troubleshooting and problem solving.

About the Person

You will have an engineering or programming degree, and at least 3 years working in industry, with hands-on experience programming PLCs, HMIs, servos drives and related devices to successfully automate production processes. You will also have exceptional verbal and written English communication skills which are crucial to this role where you will be interacting with a wide variety of people from production managers to factory line workers.

Candidates must be Australian citizens or permanent residents.

Maybe you've had a series of contracts and are now looking for a permanent role with more responsibility. Perhaps you've been supporting one particular business or line and are now yearning for some more variety. Or maybe you're already a seasoned automation professional looking for your next challenge.

Whatever your journey, we'd love you to take the next step here at Integrelec.
