Nearmap is the Australian-founded, global tech pioneer innovating the location intelligence game. Customers rely on Nearmap for consistent, reliable, high-resolution imagery, insights, and answers to create meaningful change in the world and propel industries forward.

Harnessing its own patented camera systems, imagery capture, AI, geospatial tools, and advanced SaaS platforms, Nearmap stands as the definitive source of truth that shapes the livable world.

Job Description


The Machine Learning (ML) Systems Engineer is a key architect of the platform that empowers our teams to build, deploy, and operate AI models at scale. You will design and build the core infrastructure, pipelines, and tools supporting everything from traditional ML to Large Language Models (LLMs). This is a high-impact software engineering role for those passionate about building robust, scalable systems that improve developer velocity and enable the effective application of AI across the organization.Key Responsibilities

Build the Core Platform: Design, build, and operate our ML infrastructure on Kubernetes for model training and inference.
Develop Force-Multiplier Tools: Create tooling to streamline the end-to-end ML/LLM lifecycle (e.g., experiment tracking, RAG systems, model observability).
Drive Best Practices: Design and implement MLOps and AIOps principles to improve automation, reliability, and security.
Collaborate and Enable: Work closely with Data Scientists and ML Engineers as your internal customers to understand their needs and accelerate their work.

Personal Attributes we love to see:

Pragmatism: While extensive knowledge of ML theory is highly valued, pragmatism wins over elaborate theory when it comes to shipping products that work.
Collaboration: We believe data science is a team sport, and are after candidates who can communicate well, share knowledge, and be open to taking on ideas from anyone in the team. Having worked on shared code-bases in a commercial environment is a big plus, but it's the attitude that matters most.
Technical Skills: A decent base of python and linux are key to a role in the team. Other than that, we're pretty flexible - we know tools are changing rapidly, and will continue to do so for many years to come. Experience with tools like Kubernetes, Helm, PyTorch, Terraform, Prometheus etc. are highly valued, but not mandatory.
Attention to detail: Showing attention to detail when it counts is important.

Qualifications


Key Requirements

Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related technical field, or equivalent practical experience.
2+ years of experience in software engineering, writing production-grade code.
Strong proficiency in Python within a Linux/Unix environment.
Hands-on experience with containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes).
Solid grasp of modern software development practices (Git, CI/CD, automated testing).
Highly Desirable
Experience building or managing infrastructure on a major cloud platform (AWS, GCP, Azure).
Familiarity with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or Pulumi.
Practical experience with the MLOps/LLMOps lifecycle and its ecosystem (e.g., vector DBs, serving frameworks).
Experience with observability stacks (Prometheus, Grafana) or managing large-scale GPU workloads.

We are seeking a highly motivated self-starter with a “can do” approach and solid embedded C software design and development skills to join our Traffic and Transportation division in the Traffic Product Development Team. This role is ideal for someone with a solid foundation in safety critical real time controls systems who thrives on providing innovative solutions for our customers.




In this role, you will be working very closely with a multidisciplinary engineering team in a hands-on role at Rydalmere. This is an exciting opportunity to highlight your software real time design and development skills.




If you’re passionate about delivering exceptional new and improved designs and want to be part of a business that values proactive thinking — this is the opportunity for you!




About this opportunity:

We need a Senior Embedded Software Engineer to perform the design and development of embedded control systems for Traffic Signal Controllers. This role requires expertise in safety-critical embedded software, digital hardware integration, and control systems design, with an emphasis on compliance with SIL2 (IEC 61508) safety standards.




The successful candidate will combine strong low-level C programming skills with the ability to understand and influence hardware design (primarily digital electronics), while ensuring fail-safe and reliable performance for Traffic Signal Controllers.




How you will do it:

Design and implement safety-critical embedded software for Traffic Signal Controllers in compliance with SIL2 (IEC 61508 / ISO 26262).

Develop and validate conflict monitoring, phase control, and lamp monitoring algorithms for Traffic Signal Controllers.

Collaborate with hardware engineers in the design of fault-tolerant digital interfaces (GPIO, latching outputs, watchdogs, memory functionality, reliable flash chip programming).

Lead system integration across MCUs, SoCs, and RTOSs

Develop and execute debug code to verify designs/ customer requirements.

Implement and maintain communication protocols (SCATS, NEMA TS2, ITS standards, CAN, Ethernet) for roadside devices and central system integration.

Develop web-based interfaces for local and remote-control functionality.

Ensure robust secure communications, OTA firmware updates, and diagnostics for long-term field deployments.

Participate in safety case documentation: hazard analysis, FMEA/FMELA, traceability, and compliance with certification bodies.

Mentor junior software engineers and perform peer reviews of designs and code.

Produce design, architecture, verification, validation and software release documentation.




What we look for:

Essential:

Proven experience (10 years+) developing embedded software for SIL2 (or higher) safety-critical systems, preferably in transportation, rail, or industrial control.

Strong C programming skills for MCUs and real-time operating systems, with demonstrable ability implementing algorithms and debugging hardware/ software interactions using oscilloscopes, logic analysers, and bus analysers.

Deep understanding of digital electronics and I/O design, including watchdogs, fail-safe states, redundancy, and EMC considerations.

Familiarity with protocols and standards in the traffic and transport domain (SCATS, NEMA TS2, ITS, CAN, Ethernet, Modbus, RS-485).

Hands-on experience with real-time simulation, and fault injection for validation of safety systems.

Contribution to safety case documentation and engagement with external certification authorities/auditors.

Demonstrated ability to integrate embedded Linux (desirable) for communications/ UI while keeping safety functions isolated on RT cores/ MCUs.

Desirable:

Experience with traffic control algorithms, conflict detection, phase timing, and intergreen intervals.

Experience in secure boot, OTA update frameworks (RAUC/OSTree), and cybersecurity for embedded systems.

Exposure to Yocto/Buildroot, RTOS (Micrium, FreeRTOS), or dual-core MCU + Linux SoC designs.

Prior work in roadside, rail, transport systems or medical fields with harsh environment constraints.




Only those candidates the Company (recruitment Agency Company) introduces to JCI by resumes on JCI’s Talent Acquisitions team’s explicit request will be deemed a candidate referred by the Company.




Please note pre-employment checks – including reference checks, medical, criminal record check, and drug & alcohol testing – will form part of the eligibility process."
