This isn’t a research role. It’s about deploying, scaling, and improving ML models that directly shape mission outcomes.

The Role
You’ll bridge the gap between ML research and real-world deployment — taking reinforcement learning and related methods from paper to production.

Build and maintain data pipelines that keep training datasets clean, reliable, and scalable.
Deploy, monitor, and continuously improve models in production — balancing accuracy, performance, and cost.
Design experimentation and evaluation frameworks that combine quantitative metrics, expert feedback, and field results.
Prototype, test, and refine new architectures or approaches, translating them into robust systems.
Collaborate across product, systems, and autonomy engineers to integrate ML into operational platforms.
Stay informed on the latest research — but focus on what actually works in deployment.
You’ll be hands-on with reinforcement learning, but success here comes from strong engineering judgement and end-to-end delivery capability — not publishing papers.

Who This Might Suit
You hold a PhD or equivalent background in ML, robotics, computer science, or a related field.
You’ve also gained industry experience building, deploying, and maintaining ML systems in production.
You’re comfortable working from idea to implementation: data prep, training, evaluation, deployment, and iteration.
Understands Reinforcement Learning concepts and can translate it into deployable models. 
You should be confident with:

Training and debugging ML models.
Building reproducible experimentation pipelines.
Using modern MLOps tools for deployment and monitoring.
Turning research insights into functional code and scalable systems.
Caring about how your models perform outside of simulation.
Why Apply?
Full-time, permanent role 
Real systems, not just simulation.
High-agency, low-politics environment.
Pathways to grow into technical leadership or deep IC.
A team that values capability, impact, and pragmatism over credentials.

Build the Next Generation of AI-Driven Workflows

Our client is an early-stage startup on a mission to redefine how teams work by using AI to simplify complexity, automate the manual, and surface the insights that truly matter.

Modern professionals spend far too much time on repetitive admin, disconnected tools, and fragmented data. Our client is building an intelligent system that changes that - combining automation, memory, and context-awareness to help people focus on the work that drives impact.

The Role

Our client is looking for a Fullstack AI Developer to help us design, build, and scale our next-generation platform — an AI-powered workspace that learns, assists, and evolves with its users.

This isn’t a typical developer role. You’ll be joining a small, ambitious founding team where your ideas, code, and technical decisions will shape the product from day one.

What You’ll Do

Design and build AI-powered features using modern frameworks and cloud-native technologies

Create responsive, intuitive user experiences that feel effortless

Collaborate closely with product and data teams to bring AI models into production

Own projects end-to-end - from concept to deployment and optimisation

Write clean, efficient, well-documented code that scales

Contribute to technical discussions and continuously improve performance and reliability

What You’ll Bring

2+ years of experience in full-stack development

Proficiency in React and Node.js

Strong understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript

Experience integrating or working with AI/ML models

Familiarity with RESTful APIs and microservices architecture

Cloud experience with AWS, GCP, or Azure

A problem-solving mindset, ownership mentality, and strong communication skills




If this sounds like you, we’d love to hear from you.


Please note that only candidates who meet the above criteria and hold full working rights in Australia will be contacted."
