Silicon Quantum Computing is pioneering the future of quantum technology. As the world’s first company to manufacture qubits with atomic precision, we’re delivering quantum advantage today, not decades from now.

Founded by Professor Michelle Simmons, one of the world’s leading materials scientists, SQC has achieved major breakthroughs including the first single-atom transistor and the first integrated circuit built with atomic precision. Our Chair, Simon Segars, former CEO of ARM, brings deep global experience as we scale our technology and commercial impact.

Our quantum machine learning chip, Watermelon, is already accelerating AI in ways classical systems can’t match. We’re generating significant revenue and working closely with multinational partners to solve complex problems with quantum solutions.

SQC is a fast-paced, high-accountability environment where people grow quickly and contribute meaningfully. If you’re excited by deep tech, ambitious about your career, and ready to help shape the future of computing, we’d love to hear from you.

About the role

As a Senior Hardware Engineer at SQC, you will play a critical role in the development of quantum computer hardware; working alongside quantum physicists and software engineers in the design, assembly, and testing of our next generation quantum devices. These hardware systems span from room-temperature data acquisition instruments to cryogenic quantum device control and interconnects.

This role will be focused on the design, simulation and integration of low-noise RF electronics and high-speed digital interfaces that make up our advanced measurement systems. This will involve taking responsibility for key technical deliverables, from prototype stage through to system integration and verification. As a senior individual contributor, the position is ideal for someone who thrives on solving complex engineering challenges, takes initiative in technical problem-solving, and is passionate about advancing quantum hardware technology.

Role responsibilities

Design low-noise and RF analog electronic circuits for both room temperature and cryogenic operation.

Develop Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) using Altium for automating processes in STM device preparation, as well as for custom room temperature measurement instruments and cryogenic cold finger PCBs.

Manage the procurement of components and oversee fabrication processes as required.

Test and verify circuit designs using laboratory equipment such as spectrum analysers, oscilloscopes, function generators, VNAs, and related tools.

Coordinate fabrication (PCB and assembly) for in-house designed test equipment and cryogenic devices/PCBs.

Support the deployment of new in-house developed instrumentation to cryogenic laboratories.

Collaborate with researchers and engineering teams to identify new instrument features and contribute to the development of requirements.

Take ownership of complex hardware projects from concept, through prototyping, to system integration and verification.

Maintain high standards in documentation, design reviews, and project execution to ensure robust and scalable hardware solutions.

Stay abreast of industry trends and relevant emerging technologies.

Mentor and guide others, sharing best practices and standards.

Your experience

Undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering or a related discipline.

Extensive experience in mixed-signal PCB design and/or RF electronics.

Proven expertise in electronic system design, component selection, PCB layout, circuit population and testing.

Significant experience with using common electronics test equipment (e.g. signal generators, spectrum analysers, network analysers, RF sources, oscilloscopes).

Proficient in commercial simulation software packages (e.g., Altium, LT-Spice, Matlab, ANSYS HFSS, COMSOL).

Excellent organisational skills, attention to detail, and ability to meet deadlines.

Demonstrated ability to work effectively within multidisciplinary teams.

The recruitment process

For roles at SQC, expect 3-4 interviews, meeting a few members of the team and focusing on your core eligibility for the role, your skills and how they align, and finally your values and how they align. We'll give you a more specific runthrough if you're successful in making it to the first interview.

As part of our obligations to our clients, we require that successful candidates submit to background checks, including a National Police Check, Right to Work checks, as well as employment and qualifications verification. We won't contact anyone until we're confident there's a fit between SQC and yourself.

How to apply

The best and simplest way is to apply directly here, rather than messaging anyone on the SQC team directly. If you have any questions that you'd like answered before committing to applying, please feel free to email us at careers@sqc.com.au.

This position may require access to export-controlled information (ECI) subject to EAR and ITAR. Final employment decision is contingent upon satisfactory completion of export control screenings and obtaining any necessary export licenses or approvals, based on nationality, citizenship, and other factors considered by applicable export control regulations."
