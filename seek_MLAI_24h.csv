Job Description

The Role 

We’re looking for a Lead Data Scientist to lead a high-performing team building end-to-end, data-driven products that create tangible value for hirers and job seekers. In this role, you’ll guide the inference components of our AI/ML products that help SEEK understand the marketplace, and you’ll deliver insightful analysis to enable impactful decision-making across the business. You’ll develop the team’s technical capability and support their career growth while overseeing delivery and partnering closely with Product, Engineering, Strategy, and Commercial stakeholders. 

You’ll thrive in a collaborative, fast-moving environment where alignment, estimation, dependency management, and cross-functional communication are critical. You enjoy being hands-on with models and methods, and you value continuous learning—both for yourself and for your team. 

On any given day, you might assess and guide the development of statistically sound, pragmatic models; prototype and evaluate new approaches to address real business questions; articulate the value created and the risks involved; and refine strategic thinking in partnership with Product Managers, Strategy, Architecture, and Commercial teams. You may collaborate with a dedicated Experimentation team to design and interpret A/B tests, mentor and support other data scientists by validating the value, accuracy, and limitations of their outputs, and work with Engineering and Product specialists to build end-to-end AI/ML solutions. 

Your closest collaborators will include peers across the Data Science stream, stream leads who bring Data Science, Engineering, and Product perspectives to joint problem-solving, and squad leads who track how your team contributes across SEEK’s broader AI initiatives. 

Key Responsibilities 

You will develop a deep understanding of a niche business domain—such as pricing, market position, or ad performance—and the data available to SEEK, translating that understanding into stronger decision-making within your area of responsibility. You’ll help the team turn real business problems into actionable requirements, clearly framing the value and limitations of data-driven approaches and ensuring modelling work is grounded in its business context. 

As a people leader, you’ll coach and sponsor your team’s growth, set clear goals, plan across sprints, define OKRs, and contribute to roadmaps. You’ll champion appropriate ML methods, explaining benefits and trade-offs to audiences ranging from data scientists to colleagues in Engineering and Product, tailoring the level of detail to each stakeholder. You’ll also bring strong delivery management—balancing experimentation with reliability and scale. 

 

Qualifications

You have extensive (8+ years) commercial experience building and improving data-driven products, with deep, hands-on knowledge of machine learning algorithms and model performance tuning. 

You have acted as a conduit between Data Science and Product, Architecture, and Engineering, solving commercial problems. 

You have managed a small team of Data Scientists or delivered large and complex projects. 

You’re highly proficient with Python, SQL, and Spark for data extraction and processing, and comfortable working within modern software development environments and tooling such as Git, AWS, Databricks, and MLflow (or equivalents). 

You communicate clearly, influence effectively across functions, and operate confidently amid ambiguity. 

You’re fluent on the command line in a *nix environment and hold a postgraduate qualification in a quantitative discipline (for example, Physics, Mathematics, Bioinformatics, Computer Science, or Engineering).
