The Enterprise Data & AI Architecture team sits at the intersection of strategy and delivery, shaping how Artificial Intelligence is designed, governed, and scaled across a complex enterprise. The team works hands-on with engineers, architects, and senior leaders to turn emerging AI capabilities into secure, production-ready platforms that deliver real business impact for this well-known Australian Bank.

You’ll be joining a collaborative, modern engineering culture that values experimentation, pragmatic design, and building things that actually get used.

The Role
As an Enterprise AI Architect, you’ll own the architectural blueprint for AI across the organisation. From defining reference architectures and guardrails, to influencing platform and tooling decisions, your focus will be enabling teams to move fast without breaking trust, security, or compliance.

You’ll work closely with engineering teams building AI-powered products, helping them navigate trade-offs around data, models, platforms, and risk. You’ll also partner with senior stakeholders to translate AI ambition into clear roadmaps and scalable patterns that can be reused across the business.

This is a hands-on architecture role — part strategist, part technologist, part change agent.

What You’ll Be Doing
Designing and evolving enterprise AI architecture, patterns, and guardrails
Enabling teams to build and deploy AI safely, securely, and at scale
Embedding privacy, security, and responsible AI into platforms and delivery pipelines
Shaping AI platform, tooling, and operating model decisions
Collaborating with architects, engineers, and leaders to drive adoption and consistency
What You’ll Bring
Deep experience in data architecture and governance, with a strong engineering mindset
Strong understanding of data modelling, knowledge representation, and making data AI-ready
Hands-on experience with modern cloud and AI stacks (containers, serverless, event-driven architectures)
The ability to explain complex technical ideas clearly and influence across teams and leadership levels
Experience building AI platforms, agent-based systems, or leading AI-driven change initiatives that delivered real outcomes
Previously led AI/Architectural change for large enterprise-level clients, ideally in the banking or FS sector 
Why This Role
This is a rare opportunity to shape AI architecture in an environment with real scale, real constraints, and real impact — while still working in a fast-moving, modern engineering culture. You’ll have the freedom to influence direction, the backing to do things properly, and the challenge of making AI work in the real world.

If you’re excited by building pragmatic AI foundations that enable teams to move fast and safely, we’d love to hear from you."

Major Australian Financial Services Organisation

Australia’s largest financial institutions are undergoing a once-in-a-generation AI transformation.

This role sits at the centre of that change.

Projects including building a centralised, enterprise AI platform designed to enable and scale AI across an entire banking division. The focus is on multi-agent systems, AI-native product development, and embedding AI into how teams operate day-to-day, not experimentation at the edges.

This is a senior engineering leadership role for someone who has grown up technically, understands modern AI systems deeply, and now leads at scale.
The Opportunity You will lead a high-performing AI engineering team responsible for designing, building, and operating production-grade AI platforms that power customer experiences, internal decisioning, and automation across the organisation.

This is not a pure strategy role. It requires strong hands-on engineering foundations, the ability to guide complex system design, and the leadership maturity to scale teams, platforms, and ways of working simultaneously.
What You’ll Be Responsible For
Leading and scaling a world-class AI engineering function, including hiring, mentoring, and developing senior engineers
Driving delivery of enterprise AI platforms, from architecture through to production deployment and ongoing reliability
Shaping AI engineering strategy, including agentic architectures, RAG-based systems, model lifecycle management, and platform enablement
Owning engineering standards across code quality, security, testing, observability, and operational resilience
Partnering closely with product, data science, and senior technology stakeholders to deliver AI solutions that scale across the business
Leading incident management, post-incident reviews, and continuous improvement across AI systems and services
What They’re Looking For
Proven experience leading and scaling high-performing software engineering teams (15-20+ engineers)
A strong prior background as a hands-on software engineer, with deep understanding of building large-scale, distributed systems
Demonstrated experience delivering AI or data-intensive platforms into production within complex environments
Strong understanding of modern AI patterns, including agentic systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and MLOps practices
Systems-level thinking with the ability to design platforms that balance speed, safety, scalability, and long-term evolution
Clear, confident communication style with the ability to translate technical strategy into execution
Why This Role Stands Out
Enterprise-scale AI transformation, not greenfield experimentation
Real influence over platform direction, architecture, and engineering culture
The opportunity to enable AI across an entire division, not just a single product
Backed by significant investment, executive sponsorship, and long-term roadmap
This role will suit an engineering leader who still thinks like an engineer, understands where AI is genuinely valuable, and wants to build platforms that matter at national scale.
If you’d like to explore this confidentially, apply or reach out directly for a discussion."
