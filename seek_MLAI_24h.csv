Senior AI Solutions Developer

Location: Sydney (Hybrid)
Type: Permanent
Salary: Competitive + Super

The Opportunity

We're looking for a hands-on software developer to build and integrate AI-powered services into our enterprise environment. This isn't a research or data science role — it's about shipping production AI solutions that work reliably within a Microsoft/.NET ecosystem.

You'll take established AI designs and turn them into real, running services — building APIs, integrating with existing systems, and ensuring everything operates securely at scale on Azure and Databricks.

What You'll Do

Build AI services and APIs — Develop inference and retrieval endpoints for LLMs, RAG pipelines, and ML models using Python, integrating them with our .NET platform

Integrate with enterprise systems — Connect AI capabilities to existing microservices, APIs, and legacy .NET applications

Operate in production — Deploy, monitor, and maintain AI workloads on Azure and Databricks with clear SLIs/SLOs for availability, latency, and cost

Develop secure pipelines — Build data pipelines for model training and retrieval with proper governance, privacy controls, and audit logging

Contribute to platform tooling — Work on CI/CD for models, MLflow experiment tracking, model registry, monitoring, and automated rollback

Write quality code — Deliver clean, well-tested code in both .NET and Python; participate in code reviews and maintain shared patterns

Apply security-first principles — Implement prompt protections, content filtering, access controls, and data minimisation across all AI touchpoints

Document and standardise — Maintain runbooks, ADRs, and contribute to reusable reference implementations

What We're Looking For

Must Have:

Strong development experience in .NET (C#) and Python

Minimum of 3+ years of professional experience in .NET (C#) development

Hands-on with Azure services — App Services, Functions, Container Apps, Key Vault, Azure DevOps

Experience with Azure Databricks — Delta Lake, Unity Catalog, MLflow, or similar data/ML platform work

Minimum of 2+ years of hands-on experience with Azure Databricks

Experience building and deploying APIs and microservices in production

Practical understanding of CI/CD pipelines and DevOps practices

Comfortable working with LLMs, RAG architectures, or AI/ML APIs (you don't need to train models — you need to integrate and operationalise them)

Security-conscious — familiar with identity management, secrets handling, and secure API design

Nice to Have:

Experience with Azure OpenAI or Azure AI Search

Background in enterprise environments with legacy system integration

Financial services or regulated industry experience

This Role is For You If...

You're a developer first — you ship working software, not Jupyter notebooks

You want to work with AI but aren't interested in pure research or model training

You've worked with Databricks and understand how to build reliable pipelines and workflows

You enjoy the challenge of integrating new tech into existing enterprise systems

You care about production reliability, security, and maintainability

You're comfortable in a Microsoft stack but can flex into Python for AI workloads

This Role is NOT For You If...

Your experience is primarily academic research or Kaggle competitions

You're looking for a pure data science or ML research position

You've never worked with .NET or Microsoft environments

You prefer greenfield projects over enterprise integration

About the Team

You'll join the AI Squad within the Data & AI team, reporting to the Group Manager Data & AI. The team is focused on delivering practical AI solutions that drive measurable business value — not experimentation for its own sake. You'll work closely with Product, Data, Security, and Operations to ship AI capabilities that actually get used.

Interested? Apply now or reach out to discuss.
