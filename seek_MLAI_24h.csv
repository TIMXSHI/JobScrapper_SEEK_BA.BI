Location: Melbourne (hybrid) 
Reports to: Head of AI

About Affinda Group
Affinda Group is a fast-growing AI transformation company. We help enterprises automate complex business processes through our agentic AI platform, deliver high-impact AI solutions, and train teams to use AI properly.

The Affinda platform combines advanced language models, retrieval-augmented generation, and configurable workflows so organisations can extract data, orchestrate processes, and embed AI safely into their day-to-day operations.

We are growing revenue at 100% year on year, have 2,000+ customers globally and a team of ~100 people in 10 countries. We are well capitalised and are currently investing in multiple growth engines to accelerate our ambition of becoming an Australian AI company of global significance.

The Role
You'll build AI agents for the Affinda platform. You'll also create the connectors and APIs that let AI automation work across the company.

This role sits between experimentation and production. You'll take rough prototypes and turn them into real, maintainable software. You'll figure out what works, then help the rest of the team adopt it.

This role needs both: real engineering chops and genuine enthusiasm for AI. We're open to mid-level or senior candidates depending on experience. If you tried Claude Code in the first week, or you've built your own MCP server just to see how it works—keep reading.


What makes this role special

Cutting-edge AI work: Build production AI agents—text and voice—that guide users through the app like an expert sitting beside them.

The timing: The company is scaling quickly, and we're rebuilding the platform around AI agents from the ground up. Not bolting them onto legacy systems. That window doesn't stay open long.

Tools for builders: You'll build the internal platforms (MCP servers, connectors, evaluation frameworks) that let the rest of the team build AI features without starting from scratch every time.




Key responsibilities

Design and build AI agents for Affinda. Text, voice, whatever helps users get through complex workflows.

Build our internal agent framework: MCP servers, tool connectors, evaluation patterns. Make it possible for agent complexity to grow without chaos.

Create APIs and connectors that let AI automation plug into the rest of the business—and 

into tools like ChatGPT.

Help engineers get better at AI-assisted development. Refine system prompts, build feedback loops, close the gap between ""generate code"" and ""run, test, see it work.""

Turn prototypes into production code. POCs should evolve into real applications, not get thrown away and rewritten.

Ship features in our core stack (Python, Django, Celery, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, AWS, React). AI is one part of the solution, not the whole thing.




What you'll bring

Experience: 3+ years building software in production web environments.

Backend skills: Strong Python, experience with Django or a similar framework, and familiarity with background jobs (Celery or equivalent).

AI hands-on: You've built something with LLM agents—at work or on the side. Curious about multi-agent orchestration, MCP servers, and evaluation.

AI-native development: You don't have one way of working with AI—you have several Quick prototypes, structured plans, careful line-by-line work. You match the approach the problem.

Some frontend: You can prototype a React UI when needed. Doesn't have to be your main thing.

Communication: You're good at explaining things and helping others build with AI.




Location
Melbourne strongly preferred. Open to remote for the right candidate. Hybrid for locals; we 
have a good office in the city that people actually like coming to.

At Additive Assurance, we're solving a major problem in metal 3D printing: ensuring parts are made right, every time. Companies in critical industries like aerospace and medicine use 3D printing to create everything from jet engine components to surgical implants. However, tiny, random flaws can cause these crucial parts to fail.

Our unique technology uses sensors and software to monitor the printing process in real-time, catching defects as they happen. This leads to safer parts, less waste, and greater trust in 3D printing technology. Your work will help make this advanced manufacturing technique a reliable, everyday tool for engineers worldwide.

The Role

We're looking for a versatile and resourceful Junior Machine Learning Engineer to join our small, hands-on team. You'll tackle a range of challenges involving unique industrial sensor data, with a primary focus on the deep learning models that power our defect detection.

This is a role for a true problem-solver. You won't just be tuning hyperparameters in a vacuum; you'll be responsible for the entire ML lifecycle—from designing data pipelines and training architectures for 3D segmentation to optimising models for the edge and integrating them into production code. This is a role for a builder; you'll be shipping solutions in a fast-moving environment where your work makes a tangible impact on physical manufacturing.

A Note On Our Culture: Is This Role For You?

We are a team of fast builders and tinkerers who thrive on rapid iteration and tangible results. We believe in moving quickly, learning from the results, and continuously improving.

To succeed in this role, you will need to learn quickly and adapt as you go. If you prefer a slower, more guided work environment, or if your passion lies more in theoretical research than in hands-on building and deployment, this might not be the role for you. We are looking for people who are driven by the process of creating, deploying, and seeing their solutions used in the real world.

What You'll Do

Design & Deploy: Train and refine deep learning models for classification and segmentation of unique sensor data.

ML Frameworks: Support the development of our ML framework, specifically focusing on image and 3D data.

Experiment at the Edge: Design and run experiments to push the performance of ML models on real-world hardware.

End-to-End Ownership: Learn and participate in the entire ML lifecycle, from data pre-processing through to model evaluation.

Collaborate: Work closely with our software engineering team to integrate models into our production software stack.

What You'll Bring

A Builder's Mindset: A genuine passion for machine learning and a strong desire to see your models solve real-world problems.

Technical Foundation: Solid knowledge of machine learning concepts, demonstrated through projects.

Deep Learning Tools: Hands on experience with frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow.

Python Proficiency: Strong familiarity with Python and its data science ecosystem (e.g., NumPy, Pandas).

Right to Work: You must have the right to work in Australia.

Bonus Points: Exposure to 3D data processing, computer vision, and software engineering practices (Git, Docker, Linux) is highly regarded.

What We Offer

Salary: Annual salary of $75,000 - $90,000 + super (pro-rata for part-time).

Invest in Your Growth: We provide dedicated, paid time for guided and self-directed learning to help you build a world-class foundation in ML.

Meaningful Equity: Through our employee share scheme, you'll have a real stake in our success.

The Mission: The opportunity to work on cutting-edge technology that is actively shaping the future of global manufacturing.

Collaborative Environment: A dynamic and flexible work environment at our Oakleigh office.

Ready to Join Us?

If you're a junior ML enthusiast who loves solving problems and wants to make a significant impact in a growing company, we would love to hear from you. Apply now to be part of our journey to revolutionise manufacturing!
