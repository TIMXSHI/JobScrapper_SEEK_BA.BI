About the team

About the AI Safety Institute

The Australian Government is establishing an Australian AI Safety Institute (AISI) to support the Government’s ongoing response to emerging risks and harms associated with AI technologies.

The AISI will be the government’s hub of AI safety expertise, operating with transparency, responsiveness and technical rigour. The AISI will conduct technical assessments, support coordinated government action, foster international engagement on AI safety, and publish research to inform industry, academia and the Australian people.

About the Division

The AISI is part of the department’s Technology and Digital Policy Division. The division is responsible for providing policy advice to government, delivering programs and engaging domestically and internationally on enabling and critical technologies as well as the digitisation of the economy.

The division’s priorities include implementing the National AI Plan, providing advice on the safe and responsible use of AI, robotics and automation, the role of critical technologies to support economic security, data policy and emerging digital economy issues.

The opportunity

We’re building a motivated and capable team who will be defining the AISI’s future. As a founding member of the team, you will help shape how Australia monitors, tests and governs AI. You will assess risks from frontier models, including CBRN misuse, enhanced cyber capabilities, loss-of-control scenarios, information integrity and influence risks, and broader systemic risks arising from the deployment of increasingly capable general-purpose AI systems. This is a unique opportunity to work at the frontier of AI, collaborate with domestic and international experts to shape emerging global AI safety standards and help keep Australians safe from AI-related risks and harms.

You’ll have the opportunity to drive positive change, contribute to impactful projects, and develop your expertise in a rapidly evolving field.

Our ideal candidate

We’re looking for candidates with deep technical expertise and hands-on experience working with frontier AI models.

Senior AI Safety Engineer - Science & Technical stream pay scale 8 and 9

Our ideal candidate for this role would have:

Extensive hands-on experience working with frontier or near-frontier AI models and systems, including LLMs, multimodal systems or agentic frameworks.
Demonstrated experience building and running evaluations of frontier AI systems or safety-relevant model behaviours.
Experience developing or using safety-related tooling to support evaluations, such as red-teaming frameworks, test harnesses, automated evaluation pipelines, or continuous monitoring systems.
Experience implementing and stress-testing technical safeguards or mitigations, including guardrails, filtering systems, access controls, safety-tuning methods and inference-time controls.
Demonstrated experience running large-scale behavioural evaluations, including managing logs and datasets, diagnosing evaluation or deployment issues and debugging.
A working knowledge of safety-relevant AI failure modes including robustness issues, jailbreak vulnerabilities, unintended behaviours and reliability failures.
Strong collaborative skills, including the ability to work closely with research scientists and engineers to operationalise evaluation designs and refine testing procedures.
Experience working in multidisciplinary teams and contributing to shared research and engineering workflows.

We expect these skills will be held by people with 5+ years of industry, academic or equivalent experience working directly on training, tuning, evaluating or operating advanced AI models and systems.
