Implement dimensional data models (star schemas) to support performant enterprise reporting
Integrate Power BI with Snowflake, Azure (including Synapse / Data Lake) and on-premise data sources
Monitor and optimise semantic model performance (DAX, storage, refresh, capacity utilisation)
Utilise Gen AI and AI-assisted tooling to accelerate development, automate repetitive tasks, enhance documentation and improve insight discovery

About You

Proven experience developing Power BI semantic models and advanced DAX measures
Strong capability in SQL and data transformation, with experience building or supporting ETL/ELT pipelines
