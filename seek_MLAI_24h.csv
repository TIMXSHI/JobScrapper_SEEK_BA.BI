PlasmaLeap Technologies is a globally recognised Australian clean-chemicals company reinventing how the world makes molecules. We’re decarbonising heavy industry by putting clean, distributed chemical production in the hands of communities themselves. Our proprietary plasma reactors use renewable electricity, air and water to produce green fertilisers and fuels, creating a scalable, commercially viable pathway to net-zero that strengthens food security and bypasses fragile, fossil-fuel global supply chains entirely. 

If you want to build deep tech that solves climate and food security in the same breath, and you want to do it at speed, with urgency, with purpose, and with people who are actually executing not just talking about it, then you’ll fit right in. 

The opportunity

You’ll own software end-to-end across the stack. This is a hands-on role for someone who enjoys owning and developing new systems from scratch, fast!

Embedded (PIC MCU)

- Develop and maintain firmware on PIC microcontrollers

- Implement and debug device communications: I2C, SPI, UART, RS-485, CAN

- Build robust drivers for sensors/actuators, ADC/DAC interfaces, timing, interrupts, watchdogs

- Design fault-tolerant state machines for safety-critical behaviour (interlocks, failsafes, graceful shutdown)

- Support manufacturing bring-up: flashing tools, test hooks, factory calibration, board validation

- Bring up new PCBs/modules with the electronics team: validate power rails, clocks, comms buses

Edge/Linux (rack/controller level)

Build services/applications on Linux devices (SBC/industrial PCs):

- control orchestration

- logging and data capture

- configuration management

- remote command & diagnostics

OTA updates

- Interface with modules over RS-485/CAN and expose clean APIs upwards

- Package and deploy reliably (systemd services, containers if useful)

IoT / Cloud integration

- Implement/maintain MQTT telemetry and command channels (QoS, retained messages, session handling)

- Device identity/provisioning, secure comms (certs/keys), and fleet operations basics

- Integrate data into dashboards/alerts (Grafana/Prometheus, InfluxDB, cloud equivalents, etc.)

- Build internal tools that help engineers and operators see what’s happening across devices

What we’re looking for:

Strong hands-on embedded experience (C/C++) on microcontrollers; comfortable with interrupts, peripherals, memory constraints
Real hardware interfacing and debugging experience with at least I2C + RS-485 + CAN (or can demonstrate equivalent depth)
Linux development experience (C/C++/Rust/Python/Go—pick your weapon) including system services and deployment
Experience with MQTT and IoT patterns (telemetry, remote commands, device provisioning)
Proven ability to debug across boundaries: firmware ↔ hardware ↔ Linux ↔ network
Experience shipping industrial devices or field-deployed fleets
OTA update experience
Comfortable working in a fast, iterative environment with physical prototypes

Why you should join PlasmaLeap Technologies:

We Move Fast - Build, test, and learn outside your comfort zone alongside curious, driven teammates. 

We Make an Impact - Work on meaningful challenges that decarbonise industry and improve global food security. 

We’re Getting Recognised – PlasmaLeap is earning global recognition through international awards and world-class investors backing us from multiple continents,

We Own It - Every team member has a voice and takes real ownership in a culture of experimentation as we rapidly develop, prototype and scale our technology.  

We Celebrate Wins - Enjoy fun, engaging company events while working hard on ambitious goals. 

We Reward Talent – To build the best, you have to employ the best. Competitive salary, equity, and coverage for training and conferences."
