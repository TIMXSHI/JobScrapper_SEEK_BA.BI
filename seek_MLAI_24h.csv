THE COMPANY ​YOU'LL JOIN




Established over 25 years ago, our client is a specialist provider of vehicle compliance equipment and telematics solutions, with approximately half their business being export-based to the UK, Europe, and USA.

​The company designs and owns all of its IP across hardware, firmware and software, giving them an edge in customisation and technical flexibility.​

They've developed a competitive advantage through their ability to capture exceptionally detailed data points, enabling clients to solve complex problems in rail infrastructure, mining operations, and vehicle compliance sectors.

Their solutions allow clients to achieve significant operational benefits, including maintenance cost reduction, fleet optimisation, and improved safety compliance.​

They have strategically positioned themselves as a premium, quality-focused solution rather than competing with mass-market telematics providers.​

With significant untapped opportunities in their existing markets and potential for expansion into new sectors, they are now seeking to add a new role to the business.




THE IMPACT ​YOU'LL MAKE




Technical variety with customer impact
​You’ll bridge the gap between technology, product, and customer success — working hands-on with real-world vehicle systems while shaping how clients experience the solutions.​

Blend of autonomy and collaboration
​Work directly with the CEO and global BDMs, owning your projects end-to-end while collaborating closely with R&D, sales, and product teams across Australia and the US.​

Clear purpose and visibility
​You’ll be the key point ensuring every installation and onboarding runs smoothly — a role with tangible impact where success is seen and valued at the highest level.​

Exposure to global markets and next-gen tech
​Get involved in projects spanning Australia and the USA, supporting OEMs and major transport operators using CAN bus, telematics, and connected-vehicle data systems.​

Opportunity to shape product evolution
​You’ll gather customer feedback, identify pain points, and translate them into product improvements — influencing the roadmap and helping deliver smarter, more intuitive reporting tools.​

Growth in a high-trust, agile environment
​Join a small but fast-moving team that punches above its weight, values initiative, and rewards curiosity — ideal for someone who loves learning, problem-solving, and seeing ideas quickly become reality.


THE EXPERIENCE YOU'LL BRING

Experience in a hands-on technical role such as installation, integration, or customer support — ideally with telematics, fleet, or vehicle systems.​

Comfortable working across both hardware and software, able to spot issues and explain technical details clearly to customers.​

Enjoys a small, fast-moving environment, working closely with the CEO and senior team with plenty of freedom to make things happen."

About You

You're the kind of person who takes accountability in a fast-paced, autonomous and flexible environment. Fast may be your default (like us!) but you never, ever compromise on what’s important, willing to take a steady, more informed approach when it comes to maintaining the trust of our team and customers. You handle change like a pro, and continuous improvement is a way of life. You are not afraid to speak up and share your thoughts respectfully, with the intention of making positive change. You take initiative and drive your own learning journey without waiting for someone to point you in the right direction. And ultimately, you care: about people, health and innovation. 

Experience you’ll bring:

Demonstrated track record of delivery of major technical initiatives.
Typically 4+ years successful execution at the Senior Engineer role or higher.
Experience using and implementing  CI / CD.
Experience administering and maintaining application languages such as PHP with the laravel framework
Experience administering and working with databases such as postgresql
Some knowledge of Kubernetes and AWS services 
Demonstrated experience mentoring and training other engineers
