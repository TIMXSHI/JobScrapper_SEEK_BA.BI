At Intelligen, we’re building something different. Over the past three years, we’ve evolved from a bold startup to a trusted partner for some of Australia’s most complex data transformations.

We’ve helped organisations move from legacy to modern platforms, embedded governance into decision-making, and brought AI into the hands of the business — responsibly and at speed.

But we’re just getting started. As we scale into our next phase of growth, we’re looking for Data Engineers who don’t just want to build pipelines but want to shape how modern data ecosystems come to life across Australia.

About the Role

We’re looking for a Data Consultant with solid experience in Microsoft Fabric to design, build, and optimise data solutions across modern cloud environments. You’ll work hands-on with Fabric’s Data Factory and Lakehouse components to create seamless data flows that empower analytics and AI at scale.

This role is ideal for someone who thrives on problem-solving, enjoys working across the full data lifecycle, and wants to make a measurable impact through clean, well-designed data architecture.

Key Responsibilities

Design, build, and maintain scalable data pipelines using Microsoft Fabric (Data Factory, Dataflow Gen2, Lakehouse).

Develop robust data models to support downstream analytics and self-service reporting.

Ingest, transform, and integrate structured and unstructured data from multiple sources.

Optimise data performance and reliability through monitoring, testing, and automation.

Collaborate closely with data analysts, architects, and clients to understand business requirements and deliver effective data solutions.

Contribute to standards and frameworks that promote best practices in data engineering, version control, and documentation.

Support the adoption of Fabric and modern data engineering practices within client teams.

Skills and Experience

4–6 years’ experience in data engineering or data platform development.

Hands-on experience with Microsoft Fabric, including pipeline orchestration, data modelling, and workspace management.

Strong proficiency in SQL and experience with Python or PySpark for data transformation.

Experience with Azure data services (Data Lake, Data Factory) or other modern cloud platforms (Snowflake, AWS, GCP).

Understanding of data modelling concepts, ELT/ETL patterns, and performance optimisation.

Familiarity with modern tooling such as dbt, Git, and CI/CD pipelines.

Excellent communication and collaboration skills — able to work confidently with both technical and business stakeholders.

What You’ll Bring

Curiosity and a problem-solving mindset — you enjoy understanding how things work and making them better.

A commitment to clean, scalable engineering practices and continuous learning.

A collaborative spirit — you enjoy working across teams to deliver real outcomes.

The confidence to share ideas, challenge the norm, and help build something better.

Why Intelligen?

We’re not just delivering AI and data projects — we’re humanising them. That means we care deeply about the how, not just the what. We value curiosity, creativity, and a willingness to challenge the status quo.

You’ll join a team that’s smart, kind, and ambitious — where you’ll have real influence in your projects, your practice, and our business. As we grow, so will you.

We’re building teams that are technically excellent, commercially focused, and client-first — consultants who are curious, collaborative, and eager to grow."

Macquarie University is seeking an experienced and enthusiastic Artificial Intelligence (AI) Engineer with a focus on health services research. The ideal candidate will be passionate about applying advanced AI skills to projects aimed at improving health systems and outcomes for aged care residents.

About the Role

Be part of a pioneering national research initiative addressing one of Australia's most pressing aged care challenges: the safe and person-centred deprescribing of medications for older adults in Residential Aged Care (RAC).

The successful candidate will play a key role in developing an advanced AI-augmented digital platform (AiCT-Med) powered by cutting edge machine learning models trained on multiple large, aged care datasets from providers across Australia. The platform is designed to identify deprescribing opportunities, deliver personalised medication recommendations, and support informed decision-making by residents, families, and care teams.

The role will also involve analysing large administrative health datasets and contributing to the preparation of research publications, presentations, and grant applications.

About You

We are seeking an experienced AI Engineer with expertise in machine learning and cloud-based architecture skills to lead the fine-tuning/training, design, development, and integration of the AI components of the AiCT-Med platform.
