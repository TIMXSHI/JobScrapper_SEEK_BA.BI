At Acusensus, we are building the future of road worker protection. We are looking for a Graduate Machine Learning Engineer to join a truly greenfield project, helping us design and deploy advanced technology that protects workers in high-risk environments globally.

WHO WE ARE & WHY YOU'LL LOVE WORKING WITH US

At Forsite, a division of Acusensus, we're not just building technology; we're building a shield. Every day, roadside and infrastructure workers put themselves at risk to keep our communities moving. Our Forsite division is on a mission to transform their safety.

We have a clear, vital goal: Every worker connected, every worker protected.

This is not a ""cog in the wheel"" role. Under the mentorship of senior engineers, you will help shape core architecture, build ML tooling, and deploy production-grade algorithms that power real-time hazard detection.

WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING

As a Graduate ML Engineer, you will work end-to-end across data, models, and edge deployment. You won't just be tweaking parameters; you will be getting your hands dirty with real-world sensor data, deep learning models, and NVIDIA Jetson hardware.

Key Responsibilities:

Model Development: Design, train, and evaluate deep learning models (PyTorch) for real-time object detection, tracking, and classification.
Algorithm Design: Implement algorithms for trajectory estimation, vehicle motion analysis, and sensor fusion (Cameras, Radar, GNSS).
Data Pipeline: Support the full lifecycle—collecting, labelling, cleaning, and organising datasets.
Edge Deployment: Help build reproducible workflows to export models (e.g., ONNX) and deploy them to edge environments.
Field Validation: Participate in lab and field testing to prove your code works in the real world, not just on a server.

WHAT YOU’LL BRING

We are looking for a high-potential graduate who combines strong academic foundations with a ""builder"" mindset. You should be someone who takes ownership of a problem rather than waiting for instructions.

Essential Qualifications & Skills:

Education: Recently completed (or nearing completion) a degree in CS, Software Engineering, Mechatronics, Data Science, or related fields.
Strong Academics: A solid foundation in Linear Algebra, Probability, and Statistics (High distinction/80+ average in these subjects is a key criterion).
Technical Stack: Strong programming skills in Python and C++.
ML & Frameworks: Hands-on experience with PyTorch (preferred) or TensorFlow, with specific exposure to Computer Vision.
Ownership: Demonstrated initiative to solve problems independently (e.g., through capstone projects, internships, or open-source work).

Nice to Have:

Experience with NVIDIA Jetson or embedded systems.
Knowledge of MLOps (Docker, CI/CD, ONNX Runtime).
Familiarity with C# or safety-critical systems.

YOUR WORKING ENVIRONMENT

This is a full-time, hybrid role, based in our Ingleburn office, NSW. At Acusensus, we trust our team to work in ways that maximise productivity, collaboration, and well-being, while staying connected to our mission of making roads safer.

WHY YOU'LL LOVE WORKING WITH US

Impact: Your code will directly contribute to keeping road workers safe.

Mentorship: Work directly alongside and learn from experienced Machine Learning Engineers.

Greenfield Innovation: This is a rare chance to work on a product from the early stages, influencing its architecture and design.

Flexibility: We are based in Ingleburn with hybrid working options to support your work-life balance.

A Culture of Delivery: We value collaboration, integrity, and care. We're a team that plans, forecasts, and delivers

Location: Sydney, Australia (Remote/Hybrid)
Type: Full-time (or contract-to-perm)
Comp: Below-market salary + meaningful equity (details shared with shortlisted candidates)
Stage: Fully funded startup | Existing product in market | Entering scale-up hardening phase

The opportunity

Alice/AI is building the platform that gives SME owners back 15+ hours per week by automating the operational work that currently lives across disconnected tools (email, calendars, files, CRM/accounting). We've built the core agentic AI engine and now we're entering a critical phase: architectural hardening, security uplift, and deep integrations into the systems our customers live in every day.

If you're a senior, hands-on engineer who enjoys turning a promising platform into a production-ready system—and you're open to a startup-style package (lower cash, higher upside via equity)—we'd love to talk.

What you'll do (high impact, hands-on)

You'll operate as a CTO/Lean Engineering Lead: with a product focus, making pragmatic decisions, shipping core foundations, and setting us up to scale.

1) Architecture & security hardening (first 4–8 weeks)

Review current platform architecture for scalability, maintainability and reliability

Identify and mitigate priority security risks (auth, tenancy/data isolation, API security, secrets management, audit/logging)

Produce and execute a practical roadmap for improvement (12–18 month horizon, MVP-first)

2) Build core product integrations (our MCP foundation)

Own end-to-end integrations including OAuth, sync logic, rate limits, retries, observability and data modelling:

Google Workspace: Gmail, Calendar, Drive

Microsoft 365: Outlook, Calendar, OneDrive

Xero: invoices, contacts, cashflow basics

3) Evolve the core platform

Strengthen backend services and APIs (Java) and work closely with the AI orchestration layer (Python with LangChain/LangGraph)

Improve data pipelines that feed our agents and enable reliable automation

Establish pragmatic engineering practices (CI/CD, test strategy, release hygiene, monitoring)

Our stack

Cloud: AWS (Australia region)

Backend: Java

Frontend: React Native

AI Orchestration: Python, LangChain, LangGraph

LLM integrations: OpenAI API, Google Vertex AI, Groq, AWS Bedrock

What we're looking for
Must-haves

Strong senior experience building and shipping backend/platform systems (ideally Java)

Ideally 7-8 years of experience in backend/platform systems development

Proven experience integrating with third-party SaaS APIs and managing OAuth flows in production

Practical cloud security mindset (AWS, IAM, auth patterns, API security, data isolation/tenancy)

Comfortable collaborating across Java + Python systems

High ownership: you don't just identify problems—you ship fixes

Australian work rights will be considered on a case-by-case basis for this remote/hybrid position.

Nice-to-haves

Experience with SMEs, vertical SaaS, or workflow automation products

Familiarity with agentic AI patterns, LLM tooling, or ML-adjacent product development

Exposure to compliance/security baselines (SOC2-style controls, even if informal)

Why join

Real product, real users, real mission (SMEs are under-served and drowning in admin)

Fully funded with runway to build properly (not ""week-to-week survival"")

Meaningful equity and the chance to shape the technical direction from here

Work on a modern AI stack with practical constraints (security, reliability, integrations)

About the compensation (transparent)

This role is not Big Tech cash. We're offering a below-market salary balanced by meaningful equity because we're optimising for long-term upside and impact. We'll share the band and equity range with candidates who reach first interview, and we're happy to discuss structuring (e.g., contract-to-perm, milestone-based increases).

How to apply

Send a short note with:

LinkedIn/GitHub (or a brief overview of what you've built)

1–2 examples of AI focused application you've shipped
