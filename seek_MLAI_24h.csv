The Central AI org is part of the larger Atlassian Intelligence and Rovo program. Its purpose is to accelerate AI innovation across all our products and platform, provide cohesive AI experiences and setup up an Atlassian AI infrastructure for the future.

While it's anticipated that the majority of AI-driven initiatives will be developed and executed by federated product teams within Atlassian, the role of Central AI is pivotal to this process. Central AI is tasked with constructing the underlying infrastructure and capacities, which are crucial for the seamless integration and optimal functionality of AI across various departments. By doing so, Central AI ensures that different teams within the organisation do not work in silos but have access to a unified foundation that promotes efficiency and collaboration. Additionally, Central AI is responsible for developing some of the core shared experiences typical in the AI domain, such as search, knowledge discovery and conversation.

Expertise in Python or Java with and the ability to write performant production-quality code, familiarity with SQL, knowledge of Spark and cloud data environments (e.g. AWS, Databricks)

Experience building and scaling machine learning models in business applications using large amounts of data

Ability to communicate and explain data science concepts to diverse audiences, craft a compelling story

Focus on business practicality and the 80/20 rule; very high bar for output quality, but recognise the business benefit of ""having something now"" vs ""perfection sometime in the future""

Agile development mindset, appreciating the benefit of constant iteration and improvement

It's great, but not required, if you have

Experience working in a consumer or B2C space for a SaaS product provider, or the enterprise/B2B space

Experience in developing deep learning-based models and working on LLM-related applications

Excelling in solving ambiguous and complex problems, being able to navigate through uncertain situations, breaking down complex challenges into manageable components and developing innovative solutions.
