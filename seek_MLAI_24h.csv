Job description:



You will lead the end‑to‑end adoption of AI solutions within our People & Culture function - from identifying opportunities to delivering real business value. A major early focus will be partnering with our recruitment platform vendor to ensure their AI models meet our standards for fairness, transparency, performance, and compliance.

In this role, you will:

Lead end‑to‑end AI adoption within a business squad - from identifying opportunities and shaping requirements to solution selection, delivery, and post‑launch support.
Work directly with AI vendors - challenging assumptions, asking the right technical questions, evaluating model behaviour, ensuring fairness and performance, and influencing product direction.
Partner with internal technical and business stakeholders to shape use cases, drive adoption, build user confidence, and ensure AI solutions deliver measurable business value.
Ensure all AI initiatives meet governance, risk, and compliance expectations, and that solutions are well‑designed, documented, and aligned with enterprise standards.

You enjoy solving business problems, engaging with stakeholders, and challenging vendors with the right technical questions. You're as comfortable discussing model behaviour and risks as you are explaining concepts to non‑technical audiences.

To be successful in the role you will be able to demonstrate the following capabilities / experience:

Hands‑on industry experience (3+ years) in software engineering, AI engineering, data science, or computer science
Practical experience applying AI/ML/LLM technologies in real-world projects
