Improving grounding, relevance and consistency across real customer datasets
Handling retrieval failure modes and partial or stale data scenarios




System quality, scale & reliability

Optimising latency, throughput and cost across retrieval and model calls
Implementing observability (structured logging, metrics, tracing)
Building guardrails, timeouts and fallback behaviour for agent workflows
Expertise in observability, structured logging, metrics, tracing, and automated testing strategies to ensure robust, scalable, and reliable production systems
Contributing to tenant isolation, data boundaries and security controls




Frontend contribution (important, but secondary):

Practical understanding of frontend requirements, enabling close collaboration with UI teams to align API design and deliver fully integrated, production-ready features
Translating backend capabilities into clear, usable interfaces for non-technical users
Contributing directly to the React codebase where appropriate
Ensuring tight alignment between API design and frontend needs




React experience is not required, but practical exposure is a strong advantage.




Product-driven engineering

Translating real user workflows into concrete product features
Making pragmatic trade-offs between accuracy, explainability, performance and UX
Iterating based on production feedback, not assumptions




What they're looking for

They are looking for engineers who have already built and managed sovereign AI deployments in production environments.

Required:

5+ years of professional software engineering experience
2+ years building RAG-based systems used in production
Strong backend experience




Hands-on experience with:
Vector databases
Embeddings, chunking and retrieval strategies
LLM orchestration (framework-based or custom)
Experience supporting production, customer-facing systems




Valued:

Experience with retrieval quality and failure modes
Experience with agentic workflows beyond simple chains
SaaS or multi-tenant architectures
React experience or strong API-first frontend collaboration
Enterprise or regulated environments
AWS, private cloud or hybrid deployments




Why this role might be interesting




You’ll work on real RAG and agentic systems, designed for scale. You’ll be working at the cutting edge as open source models mature, helping evaluate and deploy the best-fit models responsibly in private enterprise environments
You’ll be involved with evolving the backend architecture and user-facing product
Customers are already live, so your work has an immediate impact
Small, senior geo-distributed team with high autonomy and professionalism
Australian company building a globally relevant enterprise AI







When you apply, they're interested in:

What RAG systems you’ve built or operated?
Where they struggled or failed?
How you approached trade-offs in retrieval, latency and UX?
What kind of AI product you want to help build next?




This role is a fantastic opportunity to join a growing start up, who have already landed some major accounts and now ready to expand. You'll join an exisiting team, who is increibly talented.




What are you waiting for?... Get applying now!

Truth is, the decisions being made right now will determine the future of everything - from the local community to the entire planet. One of those decisions is: who do you decide to work for?



How will your ideas contribute to shaping what's next?

Join Aurecon's People Team as our first AI Engineer - a pioneering role dedicated to reimagining how our people experience work. This newly created position is central to transforming HR through AI, helping us deliver smarter, faster, and more human-centric solutions.

Reporting to the Director of People Enablement, you'll collaborate closely with IT, Digital, and Shared Services to integrate AI into platforms like Workday, Microsoft 365, Copilot, and Teams - making everyday processes simpler, faster, and more engaging for our people.



Here are the key things you will do to 'bring ideas to life':

Design and deploy AI agents and models to automate HR processes such as recruitment, performance reviews, and career pathways.
Integrate AI capabilities into enterprise platforms (Workday, Microsoft Copilot, Teams) to enhance workflows.
Develop and optimise prompts, models, and workflows for use across the People Function.

What we're looking for:

Proven experience designing and implementing Generative AI solutions.

Familiarity with Generative AI and agentic frameworks (e.g., LangChain, PydanticAI).
Strong understanding of automation and AI workflow design, with ability to embed AI into enterprise platforms (Workday, Microsoft Copilot, Teams).
Ability to translate complex technical concepts into clear, actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders.
Knowledge of ethical AI principles and responsible innovation practices.
Collaborative mindset with strong communication skills to work across HR, IT, and Digital teams.
Curiosity and adaptability to thrive in a fast-evolving AI landscape and pioneer new solutions.

AFR ranked us Top 5 among sustainability leaders and Top 3 of all innovative companies in professional services. One Consult awarded us an innovative design award. Plus, we were Consult Australia's large firm of the year.

But this role is more than joining a leading company - it's about being the engineer of Aurecon's AI future. As our first AI Engineer, you'll:

Drive the AI strategy for People Experience - you're not just building models; you're shaping how thousands of employee's experience work.
Drive innovation at scale - your solutions will influence decision-making, automation, and cultural transformation across Aurecon globally.
Be a thought leader - you'll collaborate in design sprints, innovation labs, and workshops,

And because we know the best ideas come from empowered people, you'll have:

Flexible work options - remote work, part-time, and job share arrangements.
Continuous learning - access to AI certifications, leadership programs, and innovation labs to grow your eminence.
Inclusive culture - we've been recognised for gender equality, LGBTI+ inclusion, and have a robust Reconciliation Action Plan.

How you can help make a better world of work

We're building the analytics foundation for Culture Amp's next generation of workforce insights. This is a hands-on Senior Data Engineer role in our Data Products team, focused on data modelling and analytical query design at scale.

What you'll do

You'll design and build the data models that power insights connecting engagement, performance, hierarchy and retention data. The goal is helping leaders understand not just what's happening in their organisation, but why.

This means:

Building analytical data models in ClickHouse, optimised for complex queries across millions of survey responses and workforce events
Designing schemas and transformations that make it easy to compute insights across multiple data domains
Collaborating with data scientists to bring statistical and ML models into production
Working with streaming data pipelines (Kafka) to ensure data lands in the right shape for analytical workloads

What makes this interesting

This work is central to Culture Amp's product strategy. We have one of the largest workforce datasets in the world: years of engagement surveys, performance cycles, and organisational changes across thousands of companies. The technical challenge is making that data queryable, joinable, and useful for insights that actually matter to customers.

You'll be building something new, not maintaining legacy systems. The insights platform is greenfield work on modern infrastructure (ClickHouse, Kafka, dbt), solving genuinely hard problems around statistical validity at scale and real-time analytics.

You Have

Strong SQL and data modelling skills. You think in sets, understand query performance, and can design schemas that balance flexibility with efficiency.
Strong Python skills for data processing and pipeline development
Experience with analytical databases (ClickHouse, BigQuery, Snowflake, or similar)
Familiarity with streaming data and event-driven architectures
Ability to work closely with data scientists. You don't need to build the models, but you need to understand what they need from the data layer.
Comfort with ambiguity. This is discovery-heavy work where requirements evolve as we learn what's possible.

You are

Self-motivated and able to work independently, comfortable dealing with ambiguity when necessary. You take the initiative to ensure that you have everything you need to work effectively and ask for support when required.
A driver of technical excellence in a team environment. You’re an expert in your domain and are able to develop the expertise and knowledge of those around you. 
Someone who loves collaboration - our teams are cross functional and you’ll be working with other engineers, team leads and product managers to deliver great outcomes together.
Aligned with our values, check them out here: https://www.cultureamp.com/company#values and demonstrate them through your working practice.

We believe that our employees are the heartbeat of our success. We're committed to fostering a work environment that truly cares for and develops its people, and creates lasting positive impact. In addition to providing a competitive compensation package, some of the key benefits we offer are: 

Employee Share Options Program: We empower you to be an owner in Culture Amp and share in our success
Programs, coaching, and budgets to help you thrive personally and professionally
Access to external providers for mental wellbeing and coaching support to sustain the wellbeing, safety and development of our people
Monthly Camper Life Allowance: An automatic allowance paid out each month with your pay - you can spend it however you like to help improve your experience and life outside work
Team budgets dedicated to team building activities and connection
Intentional quarterly wellbeing pauses: A quarterly company-wide shutdown day in each region to to collectively pause, reset and focus on restoration and rest, without having to tap into individual vacation time
Extended year-end breaks: An extended refresh period at the end of year
Excellent parental leave and in work support program available from day 1 of joining Culture Amp
