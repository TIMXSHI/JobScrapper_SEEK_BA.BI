As our Embedded Software Engineer, you'll be at the heart of our STM32-based seismic sensor development, writing efficient embedded C to bring our research to life. You'll take algorithms crafted in MATLAB and Python (including Scikit-learn and TensorFlow) and translate them into streamlined, real-time C code. You'll also drive the implementation and optimisation of LoRa/LoRaWAN communications, enabling our systems to operate reliably in the most remote and demanding conditions.

Candidates must have proficiency in C programming language for firmware development.

You will collaborate with our diverse team of technical experts spanning AI/ML, data science, hardware and software engineering, and cloud infrastructure to create robust solutions capable of handling mission-critical workloads. The software you build will directly support applications in security, defence, and remote surveillance.

At SEITEC, you're ultimately responsible for the success of our technology, through effective engineering delivery, ensuring that each product release meets the highest standards of functionality and performance.

About you

SEITEC's engineers are proudly committed to our vision and mission. We genuinely love what we do, keeping us motivated and focused. We thrive on being challenged.

We have extensive experience developing high reliability software. We're seeking like-minded people with a proven track record in building complex technologies that integrate hardware, software, and cloud-based components.

Specifically, we are looking for candidates with:

At least 5 years software engineering experience

Tertiary qualifications in Software Engineering or Computer Science

Australian citizen, with the ability to obtain a Defence Security Clearance

Proven experience developing applications in modern C on resource constrained systems

Strong problem solving and analytical skills

Excellent interpersonal skills with the ability to effectively communicate complex ideas

Strong understanding of software engineering fundamentals, with demonstrated use in real-time embedded systems. Including but not limited to: ACID properties, idempotency, abstraction and modularity, unit testing and code reviews.

And bonus points for:

Background working in a dynamic start-up or early-stage scale-up

Experience with STM-based systems

Hands-on experience building spec-compliant LoRaWAN end devices

Solid understanding of concurrency & distributed systems

Some experience in machine learning, seismic/acoustic signal processing, and/or general DSP

Experience building systems for remote and inaccessible environments.

Your interpersonal skills

We value the breadth and depth of experience that our people bring to their work. We are seeking teammates with a strong mix of technical competency and interpersonal skills.

As a key support to the CTO, you will tackle unique technical challenges that demand lateral thinking. You are an accountable software engineer, fully invested in the team's success.

At this point, we hope you're feeling excited about the job description you're reading. Even if you don't feel that you meet every single requirement, we still encourage you to apply.
