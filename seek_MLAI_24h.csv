We’re looking for a Full Stack Developer to help build and ship production-grade AI systems used by government and enterprise customers. This is an on-site, part-time role for engineers seeking long-term ownership, growth, and real production impact, not gig work.

About ExpertEase AI

ExpertEase AI is a high-velocity, founder-led AI startup building a no-code AI agent creation platform that enables organisations to deploy multilingual chat and voice AI agents in seconds.

We are supported by Microsoft, Amazon AWS, and NVIDIA as an emerging technology partner. Our mission is to democratise access to enterprise-grade conversational AI and enable business teams to build production-ready AI agents without writing a single line of code.

We operate in sprints, not marathons shipping real systems used by government and enterprise customers.

The Opportunity

We are expanding our founding engineering team and are seeking a Full Stack Developer – AI-Augmented Systems who wants to be part of a long-term journey, not a short-term contract or gig.

This is a hands-on, on-site, part-time role in Adelaide, ideal for engineers who:

Want to own systems end-to-end

Take pride in shipping to production

Are motivated, energetic, and committed to growing with a company over time

You will work across frontend, backend, AI systems, and cloud infrastructure, from design through production release, monitoring, and post-deployment optimisation.

How We Work

On-site, in-person collaboration (this role is not hybrid or remote)

AI-first engineering: coding agents are part of our daily workflow, always with human-in-the-loop (HITL) review

High-velocity delivery with clear ownership

Intense sprints during launches (project-driven, not permanent burnout)

Lean environment with minimal bureaucracy and high technical standards

Founder-led product and technical direction

Long-term mindset: we build careers and platforms, not disposable features

How You’ll Work With the Team

You will work alongside a young multidisciplinary team, including developers who specialise in frontend, backend, and DevOps.

You are expected to:

Understand the full system end-to-end

Collaborate closely with domain experts and customers

Take ownership of integration, delivery, and production readiness

This structure allows us to move fast without silos, while maintaining strong engineering discipline.
