Modernise Python APIs: Refactor and upskill the existing Python API frameworks to ensure they are performant and maintainable.
Architect for AI: Leverage your interest in AI to design platform capabilities that can support future AI workloads, model hosting, and inference requirements.
Technical Leadership: Set the standard for engineering excellence, driving the strategy for how the platform evolves to meet enterprise needs.

Skills & Experience

Proven track record leading complex engineering projects, specifically taking platforms from 0 to 1 (PoC to Production).
Deep expertise in Python (API development) and AWS.
Extensive experience re-engineering, managing, and scaling Kubernetes clusters in a production environment.
You can build advanced pipelines from scratch (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) and understand the nuances of automated testing and security scanning.
A strong interest in AI with the ability to understand its infrastructure requirements. You know how to architect platforms that can host or integrate with AI models effectively.
Ability to see the ""big picture"" of the platform, understanding how APIs, Infrastructure, and AI components interact.

Bonus Points For ✨

Experience building platforms that host Generative AI or LLM-based applications.
Background in Platform Engineering or Internal Developer Platforms (IDP).
Experience with infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, CDK).
Knowledge of MLOps principles.

What We Offer:

A collaborative and innovative work environment.
Opportunities for professional growth and development.
Competitive compensation.
The chance to work on cutting-edge projects with a team of industry leaders.

GPUs, and even TPUs, have fundamental constraints when a system needs to be scaled for global deployment of modern Generative AI models. The old architectures that served us well while Dennard scaling held are being replaced by more specialized silicon that allows greater power efficiency for application-specific tasks. AI systems such as transformer-based models are particularly suited to specialist hardware.

Advanced systems require advanced software to run them, and we have several roles available in Sydney to work on an AI device that is truly leading edge. The role would suit an engineer with strong experience in multi-threaded, multi core systems, synchronization methods, and pipelined RISC architectures. Bootloader and device driver experience would also be an advantage.
