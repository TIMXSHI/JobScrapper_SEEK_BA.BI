About the Group


The Trust & Safety (T&S) Group vision is to empower everyone to feel safe in trusting Canva. To safeguard our community, our T&S engineering teams build technologies to protect user safety (including, but not limited to their account, content, data, and privacy) and to prevent, detect, and mitigate abuse and fraud that could compromise the trust people have in Canva, such as unacceptable content, bots, account takeovers, and other abuse vectors.

Own end-to-end delivery of ML-based safety features, from technical design through production rollout and iteration

Build and maintain ML models that safeguard AI-generated content across multiple modalities (images, video, audio, text), detecting harmful content, IP violations, bias, and other safety concerns

Design and implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architectures and other advanced ML systems to enhance detection capabilities

Fine-tune and evaluate LLM-based models for content moderation and prompt filtering, making data-driven decisions about model selection and optimization

Collaborate with Legal, Product Policy, and AI product teams to define requirements, balance safety with user experience, and deliver compliant solutions

Create evaluation frameworks to measure model quality, safety coverage, false positive/negative rates, and policy alignment

Monitor production systems, respond to incidents, and maintain operational excellence through documentation and runbooks

What we're looking for:


You're a machine learning engineer with a proven track record of delivering ML-powered features in production. You bring technical expertise across the ML lifecycle—from data wrangling and model development to evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. You're comfortable operating independently while collaborating with cross-functional teams, and you're motivated by user impact and product outcomes.

Strong bias for action and product-minded approach to engineering

Hands-on engineer who loves working alongside software engineers, writing Python production code (Java/Kotlin backend experience is a plus), and solving complex problems

Experience building and deploying ML systems using modern architectures, including LLMs and RAG

Comfortable influencing roadmap decisions and navigating ambiguous problem spaces

Passionate about the rapidly evolving AI landscape and proactive about experimenting with emerging techniques

Exclusive Retained Search | Cadence Connect

Cadence Connect has been exclusively retained to appoint a Platform EDA Engineer for our client, a deep-tech company building next generation RTL simulation and synthesis infrastructure.

This is not a typical backend role. This is infrastructure-heavy, systems-focused engineering.

You will architect and scale the execution layer powering AI-driven chip design workflows, building the containerised, low-latency backend services that allow engineers to run Verilog/SystemVerilog flows reliably across FPGA and ASIC toolchains.

What will you be doing?

You will design, build and harden the backend platform that underpins:

RTL simulation, synthesis, implementation and bitstream generation
Multi-simulator orchestration (Icarus Verilog, Verilator, XSIM)
FPGA and VLSI design flows
This role is about reliability, orchestration and clean abstraction over complex EDA toolchains.

You will be responsible for...

Backend & Job Orchestration
Production-grade Python APIs (FastAPI, Flask or Django)
Stateful job orchestration with stage tracking and error recovery
Multi-user workspace isolation and snapshot management
Timeout handling, subprocess control and zombie process cleanup
Deterministic file handling across simulation runs
EDA Toolchain abstraction
FPGA flow orchestration (IP gen → synthesis → implementation → bitstream)
VLSI flow orchestration (verification, netlisting, PnR, signoff)
Unified diagnostic parsing for structured downstream consumption
Clean, predictable interfaces that shield frontend and AI layers from toolchain complexity
Cloud & Infrastructure
Containerised EDA environments with correct sourcing and configuration
CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI or similar)
Production vs development environment separation
Health checks, startup reliability and graceful shutdown
Infrastructure trade-off decisions (containers vs VMs, managed vs self-hosted)
Performance Expectations
99%+ EDA job reliability
Reduced median job latency via optimisation and caching
Zero-downtime deployments with rollback capability
Comprehensive API test coverage
Scalable architecture supporting multi-user growth
What will you bring?

2–5 years in backend, platform, or infrastructure engineering
Strong production Python experience
Docker and containerised, deployment experience
CI/CD exposure
Cloud infrastructure experience (AWS, GCP or similar)
Exposure to EDA tools or hardware design workflows highly regarded
Your technical strengths

Async programming & API design
Process management and long-running job control
Multi-stage Docker builds
Debugging complex toolchain interactions
Strong engineering discipline (testing, documentation, reproducibility)
Why apply?

You will shape the backend infrastructure enabling AI-driven chip design, a platform level engineering challenge with real technical depth.

Generative HDL & Agentic Design Systems

Exclusive Search – Cadence Connect

Cadence Connect has been exclusively retained to appoint an AI Model Engineer for a venture-backed deep tech company building AI-native infrastructure for chip design.

This is core model ownership, not a wrapper around someone else’s API.

You will build, tune and productise the AI systems that generate, refactor and debug real Verilog/SystemVerilog RTL used in real engineering workflows.

The Role

You will be responsible for the intelligence layer powering a generative chip design platform. In collaboration with the EDA engineers who own simulation and toolchains, you own how the model learns from those signals and how it improves engineering outcomes.

This is model AND product. If it doesn’t improve compile rates, test pass rates or repair success, it won't fly.

What will you be doing?

Core Model Capability
Generate clean, maintainable RTL from specifications
Refactor and incrementally edit existing RTL without destructive rewrites
Preserve ports, signal widths and interface consistency
Implement supervised fine-tuning and preference-based optimisation
Agentic Workflows

Move beyond single-shot generation by building:

Spec decomposition and structured outputs
Review → critic → repair loops
Safe edit patterns that minimise unnecessary diffs
Predictable behaviours engineers can trust
Data & Evaluation
Curate high-quality spec-to-RTL and repair datasets
Design synthetic tasks with controlled bug injection
Implement compile/test-based quality gates
Build benchmarks tracking compile success, test pass rates and regressions
Production Readiness
Improve latency and responsiveness
Contribute to caching, quantisation and versioning strategies
Monitor model quality and failure modes, not just uptime
What we are looking for...
2-5 years in ML engineering, applied research or LLM product development
Experience fine-tuning models for structured/code generation
Experience building evaluation suites and regression tracking
Ability to read/write basic Verilog/SystemVerilog
Strong Python (PyTorch preferred)
Experience integrating LLMs into multi-step or agent-based workflows
Strong engineering discipline and clear communication
What does success in this position look like?
Measurable gains in HDL generation and repair reliability
Improved structured outputs and interface consistency
Repeatable training plus evaluation cycles without regressions
A dependable AI foundation ready to scale
Hybrid working. Australia or Singapore based. Travel as required.
