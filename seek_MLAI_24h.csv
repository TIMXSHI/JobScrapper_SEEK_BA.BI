The platforms are in place. ERP is progressing. Microsoft Fabric is live. Reporting has replaced legacy systems. Vendors are engaged. Teams are busy. Yet outcomes still feel effortful. Rework absorbs capacity. Technical debt accumulates. Timelines shift. Senior leaders remain closer to architectural and engineering decisions than they should, simply to keep delivery on track.

The issue is not ambition or capability. It is operational readiness and practice maturity.

Standards vary. Modelling discipline is inconsistent. Architectural ownership is fragmented. Decisions are sometimes made reactively or too locally. Good people are working hard, but delivery is not yet operating like a well-oiled machine. It is not yet predictable or repeatable.

You can see what it could look like. Clear enterprise principles. Defined architectural accountability. Strong data modelling standards across Fabric. Vendors guided properly. Engineering and integration teams operating under disciplined patterns. Work flowing from design through to BAU with fewer surprises and less rework.

This role exists to build exactly that level of maturity.

Why This Role Exists

This organisation is a high-growth, omni-channel national retailer operating across stores, supply chain, manufacturing, and ecommerce in a live trading environment.

Over time, it has built a complex technology ecosystem spanning ERP, POS, WMS, ecommerce, integration, and data platforms. Significant investment has been made in Microsoft Fabric and analytics capability. AI and machine learning use cases are emerging, but sustainable value depends on stronger modelling discipline and architectural governance.

The constraint is not tooling. It is readiness.

Practice maturity across engineering, data, and architecture has not kept pace with platform investment. Some design decisions require rework. Modelling standards need tightening. Vendors require clearer guardrails. Senior leadership bandwidth is being absorbed compensating for gaps.

The mandate is clear:

Lift data platform maturity and modelling discipline within Fabric
Strengthen engineering and integration standards
Establish enterprise architectural ownership across platforms
Reduce rework and technical debt through stronger upfront design
Build a predictable, repeatable technology practice that scales

Architecture is not an add-on in this role. It sits squarely within your remit. You will own the architectural lens across engineering, data, and integration, ensuring decisions align to enterprise standards and scale with the business.

The Role

This is a senior leadership role, but it is not an ivory tower.

You will lead engineering, data, and architecture across internal capability and third-party partners. You will not be hired as the deepest technical expert in the room. You are hired to mature the way the room operates.

You will:

Define and enforce architectural principles and decision frameworks
Own enterprise architectural oversight across platforms, integration, and data
Uplift Microsoft Fabric practices, including modelling, pipelines, documentation, and governance
Improve engineering discipline across .NET and integration teams
Govern vendor delivery to ensure extensibility, security, and supportability
Reduce delivery rework by embedding stronger design and readiness standards
Act as the senior escalation point for complex technical and architectural trade-offs
Partner closely with the Head of Technology Delivery to ensure work lands cleanly into BAU

You will stay close enough to delivery to ask the right questions, challenge assumptions, and validate decisions, while maintaining the leadership altitude required to embed repeatable behaviour.

Environment and Context

National retailer operating in live trading conditions
Microsoft Fabric analytics environment supporting enterprise reporting and AI readiness
Active ERP and integration uplift across supply chain and digital platforms
Digital delivery cadence is strong, engineering and data practices require maturity uplift
Based at the South West Sydney head office, four days on site Monday to Thursday, with the option to work from home on Fridays

This is not greenfield. It is not broken. It is a partially mature environment that requires focused leadership to become predictable, disciplined, and scalable.

What You’ll Bring

You are a practice uplifter.

You are likely someone who started close to technology, possibly in development, data, integration, or systems roles, and broadened into leadership positions where your value came from lifting how teams operate rather than being the most specialised technical expert in the room.

You will bring:

Experience leading data or engineering teams through maturity transitions
Strong grounding in data platforms and modelling within Microsoft analytics environments
Enough architectural and software engineering depth to challenge vendors and guide standards without building solutions yourself
A track record of walking into low-maturity environments and making them materially better
The ability to embed repeatable principles, patterns, and governance across teams
Commercial judgement around AI and analytics investment, focusing on meaningful value rather than experimentation for its own sake

This is a highly visible role with broad exposure across the business and the opportunity to shape engineering, data, and architecture practice in a complex retail environment.

Hot Toast AI is building a digital workforce for finance and operations.

Not AI demos. Not slide decks about transformation.

Production systems that do real work inside real businesses.

We started in accounting because it’s regulated, exception-heavy and intolerant of silent failure. If digital workers can operate here, they can operate anywhere.

Our platform combines RPA, APIs and agentic AI into a managed AI operations layer. Clients don’t buy tools. They buy outcomes:

•       Fewer manual hours

•       Cleaner data

•       Faster close cycles

•       Confidence that nothing breaks quietly




Reliability over hype. Always.




The Role

We’re hiring a Senior AI Engineer to become the technical backbone of Hot Toast AI.

This is a hands-on building role. Not management. Not architecture theatre.

You’ll work directly with the Founder/CEO and our automation developer to design, build and ship the systems that power our digital workforce.

You’ll operate across AI, RPA, APIs and automation. You’ll work with real clients. You’ll own outcomes end-to-end.

This is early-stage. The upside is real.


What You’ll Actually Do

•       Run technical discovery with clients and translate messy workflows into structured system designs

•       Decide what gets automated, AI-assisted or left human

•       Build and maintain orchestration across RPA, APIs and AI agents

•       Design systems that act deterministically when rules apply and escalate intelligently when judgement is required

•       Implement observability, logging and control from day one

•       Pair with our automation developer to ship production systems, not prototypes

•       Partner with the Founder/CEO on product direction and platform evolution




If something fails silently, that’s a bug. If something hallucinates in production, that’s unacceptable.




What We’re Looking For

•       Strong hands-on Python engineering

•       Real experience shipping AI/LLM systems into production

•       Experience building multi-step agent workflows or orchestration layers

•       Comfort across APIs, automation tooling and system integration

•       A track record of building production systems, not just proofs of concept

•       A mindset that designs for failure, monitoring and control

•       The ability to reason about workflows and business processes, not just code

•       Ownership mentality

•       Comfortable with ambiguity and startup pace

•       Confident speaking with CFOs and operators

We can teach accounting nuance. We cannot teach engineering instinct.




Nice-to-Have

•       Experience in finance, accounting or regulated environments

•       Early-stage or startup experience

•       Experience mentoring or leading small technical teams




What We Offer

•       Competitive salary + super

•       Meaningful equity with vesting

•       Direct access to the Founder/CEO

•       A clear pathway into technical leadership as the company scales

•       The opportunity to define how AI actually operates inside real businesses




This Role Isn’t For You If

•       You want to hire before you build

•       You prefer managing roadmaps over shipping systems

•       You need detailed specs to do good work

•       You’re looking for comfort over ownership




If building reliable AI systems inside businesses excites you, we’d love to talk."

The Opportunity
A nationally critical Government regulator is entering the next phase of its cloud and cyber evolution. The cloud foundations are in place. Core platforms are operating across Azure and AWS. The migration is done.
  
Now the focus shifts to hardening, securing, and governing the environment at the national scale.
  
A multi-year cyber uplift program is underway. Identity, monitoring, data governance, and secure delivery are being strengthened across the Microsoft ecosystem. This is enterprise cloud architecture inside a PROTECTED environment. Decisions made here influence how regulatory systems operate across Australia.
  
This is not a SOC role. Not policy-only. Not GRC advisory. It is a platform-level Microsoft architecture with ownership. Think Real systems. Real scrutiny. Real accountability.
  
The Role:

You will operate as a senior Microsoft-aligned Cloud Architect embedded within a long-term cyber uplift program.
Producing high and low-level architecture across Azure and Microsoft security workloads
Designing and strengthening identity architecture across Entra ID and Active Directory
Embedding security controls into M365, Sentinel, and Purview environments
Contributing to secure SDLC integration across CI/CD pipelines
Shaping platform guardrails and governance patterns aligned to PROTECTED controls
Improving monitoring, logging, and security visibility across the estate
Partnering with cyber, infrastructure, and engineering teams to remove architectural friction
Presenting and defending design decisions within governance forums
Balancing strong security posture with operational pragmatism
Business Context:

Enterprise-scale regulated environment
Commercial off-the-shelf platforms hosted in the cloud
Strict governance and compliance frameworks
Multi-year cybersecurity uplift program
This role is structured as a 2-year FTC aligned to the cyber program roadmap. The broader program extends beyond that timeframe, and high performers are typically retained where possible.
  
What We’re Looking For:

5+ years in Azure cloud or infrastructure architecture
Strong alignment with the Microsoft ecosystem
Experience across Azure, M365, Sentinel, Purview, and identity architecture
Exposure to regulated, enterprise, financial services, or government environments
Confidence operating in structured governance settings
Clear, concise communicator with strong architectural judgement
Australian citizen with Baseline eligibility
Ideal career trajectory: Infrastructure or identity engineer → cloud/security engineer → cloud architect.
Less suited: Pure GRC or compliance-only profiles without deep platform architecture experience.
