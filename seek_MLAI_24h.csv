About the program

AIR6500 is the RAAF’s $3 billion program to develop a joint air battle management system that builds on the capabilities offered by Next Generation sensor and command and control systems. AIR6500 will create a fully networked ‘system of systems’ that synchronises air and missile defence operations in joint and coalition environments, maximising situational awareness and enhancing the speed of decision making across the battlespace.

The Royal Australian Air Force’s vision is to transform sensor and reporting platforms into a fully networked, 5th generation force able to prevail against the increasingly complex and lethal threats of warfare in the information age. Key to this vision is AIR6500, a joint battle management system that will interconnect the many disparate platforms, systems and sensors across the air, land space, electromagnetic and cyber domains into a collaborative environment that provides shared situational awareness of the battlespace and the ability to rapidly plan responses to threats.

AIR6500 is a focussed LMA program that will deliver web-based cloud service systems to develop and connect sensors with operational awareness and reporting systems to provide a representative holistic threat response environment.
