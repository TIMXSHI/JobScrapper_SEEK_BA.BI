You won't be handed specs - you'll be embedded with the team, identifying bottlenecks, and building solutions that directly impact revenue.

Design modular, composable tools following our framework principles

Work directly with the founder to identify high-impact automation opportunities

Shape the technical roadmap and grow into leading the engineering function

What You'll Bring

We're looking for someone who ships. You don't need to be an expert in everything, but you should be comfortable working across the stack and learning fast.

Strong Python and JavaScript/TypeScript skills

Experience building with LLMs - Claude, GPT, or similar APIs

Document processing aptitude (Word, PDF, Excel programmatically)

Self-directed with strong product instincts

Bonus: Claude Code, MCP protocol, or agent development experience

What We Offer

This is a rare opportunity: greenfield development with immediate production impact, direct founder access, and a clear path to technical leadership.

Full ownership of technical direction - no legacy code, no tech debt
