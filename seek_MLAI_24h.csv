It's PLC-based machine control for large-scale, oil-free centrifugal chillers used in data centres, industrial facilities and critical infrastructure worldwide.

If you enjoy Structured Text, safety-critical logic and product engineering done properly, this role will make sense very quickly.

You'll join a small, focused controls team developing control software for high-power rotating equipment where performance, protection logic and system stability genuinely matter. This is lab-based product engineering, not site firefighting.

WHY THIS ROLE IS DIFFERENT

Work on industrial machines, not building automation

Controls software for high-value equipment where failures aren't an option

Small, capable team where your work directly impacts a global product

Structured engineering environment with ISO9001 practices, testing and controlled releases

Collaboration with international engineering teams across multiple regions

Clear exposure to deeper controls, embedded systems and platform architecture

WHAT YOU'LL DO

Develop and test PLC control software using Structured Text (IEC 61131-3)

Design and maintain state machines, sequencing logic, control loops and safety interlocks

Work on protection logic, system behaviour and stability under real operating conditions

Lab-based commissioning, validation and troubleshooting

Support disciplined documentation and version control processes

Collaborate with global engineering teams on platform evolution

Occasional domestic or international project travel (planned, not constant)

WHAT YOU'LL NEED

2–3 years' experience in PLC controls or industrial automation

Strong Structured Text fundamentals and FBD (ladder-only backgrounds won't suit)

Experience with complex machine control and safety-critical systems

Background in Siemens, Rockwell/Allen-Bradley, Schneider or similar PLC platforms

Comfortable working in a structured, quality-driven engineering environment

Clear communicator with a methodical approach to problem-solving

NICE TO HAVE

Exposure to C#, Python or Java (tools, diagnostics, IPC-based logic)

Beckhoff (TwinCAT), CODESYS or other soft PLC / IPC-based control environments

Experience with Modbus, BACnet, CAN or similar protocols

Background in machinery, OEMs, manufacturing, process control, F&B, pharma or water

If you want controls engineering where performance, safety and quality genuinely matter, not endless maintenance tickets or building automation — let's talk.
