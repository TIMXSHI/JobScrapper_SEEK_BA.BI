Networking: Solid understanding of TCP/IP, VLANs, VPNs, and firewall configuration

Support & hardware: Strong troubleshooting skills across desktop and factory devices, with clear communication skills

Experience: 3+ years in a hybrid IT Operations, Systems Administration, or Software Engineering role

Highly regarded

Python: Intermediate scripting for automation and data processing, with interest in AI and computer vision use cases

Legacy & enterprise systems: Experience with C# .NET, PostgreSQL, or NetSuite / SuiteScript

Design modular, composable tools following our framework principles

Work directly with the founder to identify high-impact automation opportunities

Shape the technical roadmap and grow into leading the engineering function

What You'll Bring

We're looking for someone who ships. You don't need to be an expert in everything, but you should be comfortable working across the stack and learning fast.

Strong Python and JavaScript/TypeScript skills

Experience building with LLMs - Claude, GPT, or similar APIs

Document processing aptitude (Word, PDF, Excel programmatically)

Self-directed with strong product instincts

Bonus: Claude Code, MCP protocol, or agent development experience

What We Offer

This is a rare opportunity: greenfield development with immediate production impact, direct founder access, and a clear path to technical leadership.
