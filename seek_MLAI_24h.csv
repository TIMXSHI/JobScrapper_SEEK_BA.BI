Rubidium develops automation and inspection solutions for the sports and lighting industries. Our flagship product, the RB Rover, is a field robot that performs sports lighting audits — driving measurement grids across sports fields to collect illumination and positional data for compliance, reporting and design feedback.

We are now entering the next phase of RB Rover’s development: redesigning its body for durability and manufacturability, and upgrading its Cube-based navigation and control system for robust, repeatable, autonomous operation.

The Role

We’re looking for a Robotics Product Engineer (Mechanical & Controls) to take ownership of the redesign and system upgrades. You’ll work hands-on across mechanical design, control system integration, and field testing, delivering a production-ready robot that can reliably complete missions in real-world sports-field conditions.

Redesign RB Rover’s chassis and sensor mast(s) with a focus on durability, weather resistance, weight distribution, and serviceability.

Engineer mounting and wiring solutions for payloads (lux meters, LiDAR, GNSS, cameras, IMU, encoders).

Design for manufacture — materials selection, processes, and production drawings.

Implement and tune navigation/control systems leveraging the Cube autopilot system (CubePilot/ArduPilot ecosystem).

Integrate and calibrate sensors into the Cube stack; develop robust sensor-fusion pipelines (GNSS, LiDAR, IMU, encoders).

Improve motion control, safety limits, and power management (battery systems, BMS integration, swap procedures).

Plan and conduct field testing, collecting telemetry and iterating designs.

Deliver complete engineering documentation (CAD, BOM, wiring diagrams, parameter sets, software/firmware notes, test reports, and maintenance guides).

About you

Must have:

Degree in Mechanical, Mechatronics, Robotics Engineering, or equivalent.

3–7+ years experience designing outdoor/industrial products.

Hands-on robotics/control system experience with CubePilot/ArduPilot or PX4.

Embedded systems experience: Cube autopilot integration, motor controllers, companion computers.

Field testing and iteration experience.

Nice to have:

Experience with RTK GNSS, LiDAR-based SLAM/localization.

Designing to IP ratings (IP54–IP65).

Industrial design or ergonomics experience.

Prior experience with outdoor inspection/agricultural robots.

Knowledge of DFMA and supplier engagement in Australia/APAC.

Tools & platforms you’ll use

Cube autopilot (CubePilot/ArduPilot, MAVLink)

ROS/ROS2 for higher-level logic

CAD: SolidWorks / Fusion360

LiDAR, GNSS, IMU, cameras

Embedded platforms: Cube + companion computer (Jetson/Raspberry Pi)

What success looks like

Robust Cube-based navigation stack that completes ≥95% of missions without manual rescue.

Positional repeatability of <0.2 m across audit grids.

Serviceable, weather-resistant body design ready for production.

Comprehensive documentation for manufacturing and operation.

Why join us?

Be part of a pioneering robotics product in the sports technology sector.

Hands-on role with direct impact from design through to field deployment.

Flexible work pattern, based in Queensland with real-world testing on sports fields.

Contract or permanent pathway available.

We have the clients. We have the use cases. We have the blueprint. Join us while we build the infrastructure that makes it real.

You'll join the team that is building the platform that deploys and manages an agentic workforce - starting with our own clients, then expanding globally to transform how businesses work.

Who We're After

Ship fast, learn faster: These tools are evolving weekly - we build, test, iterate

Own your decisions: No committees - you architect it, you build it, you own it

Customer-driven: Every feature ships to a real business within days

Who You'll Work With

Our exceptional team and you'll work directly with the founder, a proven entrepreneur who's built and exited companies before. No layers, no politics - direct access to leadership and immediate impact on company direction. This isn't his first rodeo, and he knows how to build both products and teams.

10-20% time for R&D/experimentation with new AI tools
