About the role

In this role you will be a subject matter expert, filling a critical knowledge gap in your engineering team. Given that our company heavily relies on software to enhance hardware performance, this person must have a strong multidisciplinary background across physics, electronics, and software.

The ideal candidate would have a unique blend of hands-on testing experience and a deep theoretical understanding of sensor technologies. Your background should bridge the gap between our software, mechanical, and electronic engineering teams.


What you'll do

Contribute to the research and development of novel, internally-developed sensor technologies.

Provide expert guidance to the engineering team on the critical properties of sensors for inertial navigation systems.

Develop and implement advanced sensor calibration techniques to optimise system performance.

Lead the testing, characterisation, and selection of third-party inertial sensors.

Analyse test data to identify sensor performance limitations and areas for improvement.

Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate sensors into our diverse product range, from low-cost to high-end systems.

Qualifications

Sensor Testing and Characterisation: They must have proven experience in designing and executing tests for inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes). This includes understanding test methodologies, sources of error, and how to analyse the resulting data.

Sensor Development: Experience in the development of new sensors is crucial. This could involve technologies like MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems), FOG (Fibre-Optic Gyroscopes), or other emerging sensor tech. This experience ensures they can contribute to your in-house sensor development.

Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) Expertise: A deep understanding of how sensor characteristics impact the performance of an INS is paramount. They should be able to identify which sensor properties are most critical for your high-performance navigation systems.

Calibration Techniques: The candidate should be proficient in advanced sensor calibration methods to minimise errors and optimise performance.

Software and Data Analysis Skills: Proficiency in software tools used for data acquisition and analysis, such as Python or MATLAB, is important.
Industry Experience: While not mandatory, experience in one of our key industries—like defense, maritime, or autonomous vehicles—would be a significant plus

Educational Background: A degree in a relevant field such as Physics, Mechatronics, Electrical Engineering, or a closely related discipline is essential. An advanced degree (Master's or PhD) would be highly advantageous, especially if their research was focused on sensor technology or inertial navigation. Australian citizens are desirable for security reasons, ADF experience is highly regarded and Veterans are encouraged to apply"
