89364476,Software Engineer (AI),Heidi Health,https://www.seek.com.au/job/89364476?type=standard&ref=search-standalone&origin=jobCard#sol=bf2fa5694bb1bbe383c3503853ac468f3a92d055,2h ago,2.0,2025-12-30T00:00:00+00:00,Sydney NSW (Hybrid),Developers/Programmers (Information & Communication Technology),Full time,,"Heidi is building an AI Care Partner that supports clinicians every step of the way, from documentation to delivery of care.

We exist to double healthcare’s capacity while keeping care deeply human. In 18 months, Heidi has returned more than 18 million hours to clinicians and supported over 73 million patient visits. Today, more than two million patient visits each week are powered by Heidi across 116 countries and over 110 languages.

Founded by clinicians, Heidi brings together clinicians, engineers, designers, scientists, creatives, and mathematicians, working with a shared purpose: to strengthen the human connection at the heart of healthcare.

Backed by nearly $100 million in total funding, Heidi is expanding across the USA, UK, Canada, and Europe, partnering with major health systems including the NHS, Beth Israel Lahey Health, MaineGeneral, and Monash Health, among others.

We move quickly where it matters and stay grounded in what’s proven, shaping healthcare’s next era. Ready for the challenge?




What you’ll do:

Architect and build backend services that power LLM-based agents and clinical automations.

Design robust APIs & data models that are secure, observable and easy for other teams to extend.

Optimise performance and cost—profile hot paths, tune databases and right-size cloud resources.

Automate quality: write unit / integration tests, craft alerts and own on-call runbooks so clinicians can trust every interaction.

Partner with product, design and other engineers to ship new capabilities from concept to production in weeks, not quarters.


What we will look for:

Mastery of Fullstack fundamentals: You are equally proficient in Python and modern frontend frameworks (React/TypeScript), capable of owning a feature from the database schema to the UI interaction.

Applied AI & Voice fluency: You have a working knowledge of LLM integration (RAG, prompt engineering) and audio technologies (ASR, speech processing) and know how to build around their probabilistic nature.

Pragmatic problem solving: You balance engineering purity with the need for speed; you know when to build a robust system and when to ship a tactical solution to unblock a customer.

Cloud fluency (AWS or GCP): You can spin up your own infrastructure (containers, serverless functions) and manage CI/CD pipelines to get your code into the hands of users independently.

Rigorous testing in production: You understand that ""works on my machine"" isn't enough; you implement observability and feedback loops to monitor how your AI features perform in the wild.




What do we believe in?

Heidi builds for the future of healthcare, not just the next quarter, and our goals are ambitious because the world’s health demands it. We believe in progress built through precision, pace, and ownership.

Live Forever - Every release moves care forward: measured, safe, and built to last. Data guides us, but patients define the truth that matters.

Practice Ownership - Decisions follow logic and proof, not hierarchy. Exceptional care demands exceptional standards in our work, our thinking, and our character.

Small Cuts Heal Faster - Stability earns trust, speed delivers impact. Progress is about learning fast without breaking what people depend on.

Make others better - Feedback is direct, kindness is constant, and excellence lifts everyone. Our success is measured by collective growth, not individual output.

Our mission is clear: expand the world’s capacity to care, and do it without losing the humanity that makes care worth delivering.




Why you will flourish with us?

Flexible work with a 50% hybrid environment

Additional paid day off for your birthday and wellness days

A generous personal development budget of $500 per annum

Learn from some of the best engineers and creatives, joining a diverse team
