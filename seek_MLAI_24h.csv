About the job


As a Field Solutions Architect at Google Cloud, you are an embedded builder who bridges the gap between frontier AI products and production-grade reality within customers. Unlike traditional advisory roles, you function as a 'builder-consultant', moving beyond high-level architecture to code, debug, and jointly ship bespoke agentic solutions directly within the customer’s environment.

This role is designed for high-agency engineers with a founder’s mindset. You will work on blocker to production including solving the integration complexities, data readiness issues, and state-management challenges that prevent AI from reaching enterprise-grade maturity. By embedding with strategic accounts, you serve a dual purpose: providing 'white glove' deployment of complex AI systems and acting as a critical feedback loop, and transforming real-world field insights into Google Cloud’s future product roadmap.

Google Cloud accelerates every organization’s ability to digitally transform its business and industry. We deliver enterprise-grade solutions that leverage Google’s cutting-edge technology, and tools that help developers build more sustainably. Customers in more than 200 countries and territories turn to Google Cloud as their trusted partner to enable growth and solve their most critical business problems.

Responsibilities

Serve as the lead developer for complex AI applications, transitioning from rapid prototypes to production-grade agentic workflows (e.g., multi-agent systems, MCP servers) that drive measurable ROI.
Architect and code the connection between Google’s AI products and customer's live infrastructure, including APIs, legacy data silos, and security perimeters.
Build high-performance evaluation pipelines and observability frameworks to ensure agentic systems meet rigorous requirements for accuracy, safety, and latency.
Identify repeatable field patterns and technical 'friction points' in Google’s AI stack, converting them into reusable modules or formal product feature requests for the engineering teams.
Drive engineering excellence across the JAPAC region by mentoring talent, co-building with customer teams to instill best practices, and influencing cross-functional strategies to uplevel organizational technical capabilities.
