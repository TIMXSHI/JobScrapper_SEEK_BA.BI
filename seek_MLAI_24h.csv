You're in the right place. If you're looking for a fresh challenge, why choose Aurecon? It comes down to one, crucial question: What kind of world do you want to create for the next generation? Truth is, the decisions being made right now will determine the future of everything - from the local community to the entire planet. One of those decisions is: who do you decide to work for?



How will your ideas contribute to shaping what's next?

Join Aurecon's People Team as our first AI Engineer - a pioneering role dedicated to reimagining how our people experience work. This newly created position is central to transforming HR through AI, helping us deliver smarter, faster, and more human-centric solutions.

Working at the intersection of technology and human experience, you'll embed AI into core HR workflows and champion responsible innovation. Reporting to the Director of People Enablement, you'll collaborate closely with IT, Digital, and Shared Services to integrate AI into platforms like Workday, Microsoft 365, Copilot, and Teams - making everyday processes simpler, faster, and more engaging for our people.



Here are the key things you will do to 'bring ideas to life':

Design and deploy AI agents and models to automate HR processes such as recruitment, performance reviews, and career pathways.
Integrate AI capabilities into enterprise platforms (Workday, Microsoft Copilot, Teams) to enhance workflows.
Develop and optimise prompts, models, and workflows for use across the People Function.

Monitor and improve AI performance, retraining models and refining prompts for accuracy and fairness.

What we're looking for:

Proven experience designing and implementing Generative AI solutions.
Proficiency in Python and JavaScript.
Familiarity with Generative AI and agentic frameworks (e.g., LangChain, PydanticAI).
Strong understanding of automation and AI workflow design, with ability to embed AI into enterprise platforms (Workday, Microsoft Copilot, Teams).
Ability to translate complex technical concepts into clear, actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders.
Knowledge of ethical AI principles and responsible innovation practices.
Collaborative mindset with strong communication skills to work across HR, IT, and Digital teams.
Curiosity and adaptability to thrive in a fast-evolving AI landscape and pioneer new solutions.

Joining Aurecon means you'll be at the award-winning edge of innovation and sustainability. AFR ranked us Top 5 among sustainability leaders and Top 3 of all innovative companies in professional services. One Consult awarded us an innovative design award. Plus, we were Consult Australia's large firm of the year.

But this role is more than joining a leading company - it's about being the engineer of Aurecon's AI future. As our first AI Engineer, you'll:

Drive the AI strategy for People Experience - you're not just building models; you're shaping how thousands of employee's experience work.
Drive innovation at scale - your solutions will influence decision-making, automation, and cultural transformation across Aurecon globally.
Be a thought leader - you'll collaborate in design sprints, innovation labs, and workshops,

And because we know the best ideas come from empowered people, you'll have:

Flexible work options - remote work, part-time, and job share arrangements.
Continuous learning - access to AI certifications, leadership programs, and innovation labs to grow your eminence.
Inclusive culture - we've been recognised for gender equality, LGBTI+ inclusion, and have a robust Reconciliation Action Plan.
Wellbeing and lifestyle benefits - competitive paid parental leave, cultural holiday swaps, and wellbeing support programs.

How you can help make a better world of work

We're building the analytics foundation for Culture Amp's next generation of workforce insights. This is a hands-on Senior Data Engineer role in our Data Products team, focused on data modelling and analytical query design at scale.

What you'll do

You'll design and build the data models that power insights connecting engagement, performance, hierarchy and retention data. The goal is helping leaders understand not just what's happening in their organisation, but why.

This means:

Building analytical data models in ClickHouse, optimised for complex queries across millions of survey responses and workforce events
Designing schemas and transformations that make it easy to compute insights across multiple data domains
Collaborating with data scientists to bring statistical and ML models into production
Working with streaming data pipelines (Kafka) to ensure data lands in the right shape for analytical workloads

What makes this interesting

This work is central to Culture Amp's product strategy. We have one of the largest workforce datasets in the world: years of engagement surveys, performance cycles, and organisational changes across thousands of companies. The technical challenge is making that data queryable, joinable, and useful for insights that actually matter to customers.

You'll be building something new, not maintaining legacy systems. The insights platform is greenfield work on modern infrastructure (ClickHouse, Kafka, dbt), solving genuinely hard problems around statistical validity at scale and real-time analytics.

You Have

Strong SQL and data modelling skills. You think in sets, understand query performance, and can design schemas that balance flexibility with efficiency.
Strong Python skills for data processing and pipeline development
Experience with analytical databases (ClickHouse, BigQuery, Snowflake, or similar)
Familiarity with streaming data and event-driven architectures
Ability to work closely with data scientists. You don't need to build the models, but you need to understand what they need from the data layer.
Comfort with ambiguity. This is discovery-heavy work where requirements evolve as we learn what's possible.

You are

Self-motivated and able to work independently, comfortable dealing with ambiguity when necessary. You take the initiative to ensure that you have everything you need to work effectively and ask for support when required.
A driver of technical excellence in a team environment. You’re an expert in your domain and are able to develop the expertise and knowledge of those around you. 
Someone who loves collaboration - our teams are cross functional and you’ll be working with other engineers, team leads and product managers to deliver great outcomes together.
Aligned with our values, check them out here: https://www.cultureamp.com/company#values and demonstrate them through your working practice.

We believe that our employees are the heartbeat of our success. We're committed to fostering a work environment that truly cares for and develops its people, and creates lasting positive impact. In addition to providing a competitive compensation package, some of the key benefits we offer are: 

Employee Share Options Program: We empower you to be an owner in Culture Amp and share in our success
Programs, coaching, and budgets to help you thrive personally and professionally
Access to external providers for mental wellbeing and coaching support to sustain the wellbeing, safety and development of our people
Monthly Camper Life Allowance: An automatic allowance paid out each month with your pay - you can spend it however you like to help improve your experience and life outside work
Team budgets dedicated to team building activities and connection
Intentional quarterly wellbeing pauses: A quarterly company-wide shutdown day in each region to to collectively pause, reset and focus on restoration and rest, without having to tap into individual vacation time
Extended year-end breaks: An extended refresh period at the end of year
Excellent parental leave and in work support program available from day 1 of joining Culture Amp
5 Social Impact Days a year to make a positive impact on the community outside of work
MacBooks for you to do your best & a work from home office budget to spend on setting up your home office
Medical insurance coverage for you and your family (Available for US & UK only)

MotorPlatform is Australia’s fastest-growing B2B automotive marketplace and SaaS platform.

The core platform is built. The next phase is the hard, high-leverage work: scaling product, scaling engineering, and scaling operational excellence, while we shift to being AI-first in how we build and how the platform creates value.

The role

We’re hiring a Senior Full-Stack Engineer to act as Deputy Lead / 2IC in engineering. You’ll be a hands-on builder who can take ownership of major initiatives, lead projects end-to-end, and keep delivery moving with clarity and discipline.

Shipping analytics and insights (vehicle acquisition and disposal performance, liquidity signals, margin drivers)

Productionising data/AI services: API contracts, monitoring, quality checks, fallbacks, latency and cost controls

Building internal tools for faster decisions (dashboards, alerts, workflow automation)

You don’t need an ML background. You do need to be comfortable shipping AI-enabled features responsibly and using AI to increase leverage.

Testing frameworks (PHPUnit/Pest, Jest/Mocha)

Why this is a strong next step

The platform is real and growing and your work immediately compounds

You’ll have leadership scope without being removed from building

You’ll help shape how we scale and how we embed AI into the business

You’ll work closely with Product and influence what gets built and why
