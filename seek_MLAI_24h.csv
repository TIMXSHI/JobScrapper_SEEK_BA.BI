Our flagship office is in Sydney, Australia, but we've made our way from down under, to a hub in San Francisco, which is now home to our US operations. We offer flexibility in how and where you work. We trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals.

Job Description

At Canva, our mission is to empower the world to design. To ensure our generative AI models are truly helpful, we are seeking a talented Research Engineer to build the foundational datasets and systems that fuel our next-generation generative AI models and evaluation capabilities.

About the role:

In this foundational role, you will be the expert on what truly fuels our models: data. You'll own the end-to-end lifecycle of our critical datasets, from curating nuanced human feedback on design quality to pioneering machine learning for high-quality synthetic data generation. This unique position calls for a data-first thinker with a strong design sensibility, passionate about building the high-quality ground truth at scale that will define the future of creativity by ensuring our models align with human taste and intent.

At the moment, this role is focused on:

Statistical Analysis & Insights: Applying robust statistical methodologies to analyze data, identify significant trends, and derive actionable insights. This includes hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and determining statistical significance to validate model performance and user preferences.

Human Feedback Data Curation: Owning the design, processing, cleaning, and strategic curation of large-scale, subjective human feedback on design quality, which is the lifeblood of our models.

Synthetic Data Generation: Using generative AI and machine learning techniques to create novel, high-quality synthetic data that augments our training sets and improves model capabilities.

Alignment Analysis & Evaluation Design: Designing methods to analyze outputs from both human and automated systems to deeply understand and measure our models' alignment with user preferences.

Primary Responsibilities:

Design and build scalable pipelines for processing and curating large datasets of human design feedback.

Research and develop ML models to generate high-quality synthetic data for training and fine-tuning.

Own the design and implementation of human evaluation workflows, including creating guidelines and quality rubrics.

Prepare datasets for automated evaluation systems and conduct deep analysis of their outputs to provide robust signals on model performance and human alignment.

Design and analyze experiments to measure the real-world impact of our models on design quality.

Conduct deep-dive analyses into model performance to identify failure modes and guide future development.

You’re probably a match if you have:

A strong aesthetic sense, with a background or demonstrated passion for visual design or human-computer interaction.

Strong proficiency in Python and ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).

Extensive experience with designing and implementing large-scale data processing workflows using libraries like Pandas and data warehousing solutions such as Snowflake.

Solid understanding of statistical methods, including experimental design, A/B testing, and quality evaluation systems.

Experience with generative AI and synthetic data generation is highly desirable.

Nice to have:

Experience with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) for data storage, processing, and MLOps related to dataset management.

Experience with MLOps practices and tools specifically for data versioning, lineage, and pipeline automation.

Ability to develop data visualization or data collection interfaces (e.g., TypeScript, Python).
