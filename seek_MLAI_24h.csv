Specify data models, canonical schemas, ontologies and metadata standards to enable cross‑domain interoperability (engineering, operations, logistics, analytics).
Establish data governance, stewardship, cataloguing and lifecycle policies that incorporate export control, data rights, IP, and cross‑jurisdictional access constraints.
Define secure data integration and exchange patterns.
Develop architectures for efficient analytics and ML/AI workflows (data lakes, feature stores, data warehouses, MLOps pipelines) supporting test analysis, performance trending and predictive maintenance.
Create reference implementation patterns and reusable data platform blueprints for supplier/partner onboarding and rapid capability delivery.
Collaborate with security, export control, legal and compliance teams to ensure architecture meet export constraints and national security requirements.
Define interoperability contracts, APIs, data contracts and SLAs for internal systems and external partners/nations.
Lead data migrations, ingestion design and coexistence strategies for existing PLM/ALM/SE systems and new data platforms.
Produce architecture artefacts including data flow diagrams, logical & physical data models, data lifecycle diagrams, capacity & cost models and interface specifications.
Provide technical leadership and mentoring to data engineers, platform teams and stakeholders.
Communicate architecture rationale, risks, cost/benefit tradeoffs and timelines to program leadership and international partners.
