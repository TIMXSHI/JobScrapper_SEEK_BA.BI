We are an established systems integration contractor offering industrial automation and consulting services across a wide variety of industries.

Our mission is to help local manufacturing and processing businesses to be as successful as they possibly can be through skillful application of the latest control system technologies. Our customers include large well-known brands, as well as emerging businesses bringing exciting new products to the market.

Clients throughout Australia have been so thrilled with our practical and innovative approach to automating their processes and boosting their efficiency that demand for our services is at an all-time high. We therefore need to expand our incredible team of technology innovators with more skilled individuals who are seeking to make a real difference.

About the Role

We are looking for versatile engineers with real-world experience in machine control systems, especially industrial software platforms like Siemens, Rockwell, Phoenix and others.

The role has a fantastic amount of variety both in the technologies you'll deal with and the applications you'll encounter. Our wide cross-section of customers will provide you with opportunity to learn about many different industrial manufacturing processes for everything from food and beverage to steel tube forming, timber milling to concrete batching, textile weaving to material packaging, standalone machines to entire lines.

You will play a vital role across all stages of the job lifecycle. A typical week will consist of a mix of project work (typically 1-3 projects running concurrently), an occasional spot of troubleshooting for a breakdown at a customer site, some time assisting other team members, and always honing your skills through regular professional development and learning.

On average approximately half of your time will be spent in the office on system design and program preparation, and half out on sites commissioning and tuning your systems. Some working-from-home is available, and a small amount of regional and interstate travel is involved from time to time.

Supported by great colleagues you will carry out tasks such as:

Scoping and investigating requirements for new projects,

Advising and guiding customers in their choice of technologies and system architectures.

Designing, developing and commissioning PLC code and HMI interfaces

Programming inverters for induction motors and servo drive motion controls

Creating execution sequences for pneumatic and hydraulic actuators

Installing and configuring all manner of instrumentation sensors

Implementing safety access controls and interlocks

Industrial networking (both TCP/IP and serial-based field buses)

Planning and monitoring project phases

Mentoring less experienced staff

Providing advice to installation teams,

Troubleshooting and problem solving.

About the Person

You will have an engineering or programming degree, and at least 3 years working in industry, with hands-on experience programming PLCs, HMIs, servos drives and related devices to successfully automate production processes. You will also have exceptional verbal and written English communication skills which are crucial to this role where you will be interacting with a wide variety of people from production managers to factory line workers.

Candidates must be Australian citizens or permanent residents.

Maybe you've had a series of contracts and are now looking for a permanent role with more responsibility. Perhaps you've been supporting one particular business or line and are now yearning for some more variety. Or maybe you're already a seasoned automation professional looking for your next challenge.

Whatever your journey, we'd love you to take the next step here at Integrelec.

If this sounds like the role for you, then please submit your resume and follow it up by calling our office directly on (07) 3123 9538 to introduce yourself."
