At Smartmoney Wealth Management, we’re building technology to make money clear, visible, and actionable in a world where finances are increasingly digital and fragmented.

Alongside our core advice business, we have already commenced building a new AI-driven financial intelligence platform. The next phase is execution — getting it live, reliable, and delivering real outcomes.

We’re looking for an experienced AI Solutions Engineer to help finish, deploy, and scale this platform, while also applying AI to improve internal processes across the Smartmoney business.

The role

This is a hands-on execution role.

You will:

Take an already-started AI platform and get it live and working correctly

Build, refine, and deploy AI systems using real financial and property data

Implement LLM- and agent-based systems where they create measurable efficiency

Improve internal workflows at Smartmoney using AI (analysis, automation, decision support)

Work directly with the founders and senior team

Own delivery, not just design

This is not a research or advisory role. It is about deploying and improving real systems.

Who this is for

You are an experienced AI engineer who:

Has deployed AI systems into production

Is comfortable working end-to-end with imperfect data

Enjoys taking something part-built and making it work properly

Can balance speed, quality, and reliability

Wants their work used daily, not parked in a roadmap

Fintech or regulated-environment experience is useful, not mandatory.

Location & compensation

Hybrid (Australia-based)

Competitive salary

Equity available for the right candidate

Why this role matters

You’ll help bring a new AI platform from build to live

You’ll directly improve how a real wealth management business operates

You’ll work closely with decision-makers, not through layers

Strong pathway to expanded technical leadership as the platform scales
