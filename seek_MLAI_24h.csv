We are looking for an AI Systems Engineer to play a pivotal role in building and maintaining our AI operational environment. This is not a role for just deploying models. You will help create the scalable, automated, and reliable platform that turns our AI ambitions into reality. You will be a critical link between a great idea and a product that works flawlessly in the real world, for every user, every time.

What You Will Do

Drive the deployment lifecycle. You will help design, build, and manage the CI/CD pipelines that get our AI solutions to production quickly, consistently, and safely. You will implement GitOps principles to ensure our entire system state is declarative, versioned, and auditable.
Engineer for scale and efficiency. You will manage our cloud infrastructure and containerised environments, constantly optimising for performance and cost effectiveness. You will build robust systems for managing data pipelines and artifact lifecycles, ensuring proper versioning, storage, and governance across all our technical assets.
Build the ""factory floor"" for our AI team. You will create reusable, modular workflows and systems that empower our entire team to build and integrate AI components faster and more effectively, supporting everything from traditional models to complex, agentic systems. This includes developing internal SDKs, template repositories, and self service tools that allow teams to independently leverage our AI infrastructure without deep platform knowledge.
Be a guardian of our systems. You will set up comprehensive monitoring to track system health and model performance, and you will implement the technical controls that ensure our AI is secure, compliant, and trustworthy. You will engineer compliance and data governance directly into our systems, ensuring sensitive data handling and audit trails are built in from the ground up, not bolted on later.
Bridge diverse technical environments. You will design and build integrations that allow our AI systems to work seamlessly across different platforms and environments, from cloud native services to on premise systems, ensuring our solutions can operate wherever they are needed.

What You Will Bring

A solid background in MLOps, DevOps, AI infrastructure, or a similar technical role, with about 2 to 4 years of hands on experience.
Practical experience with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP, along with containerisation tools like Docker and orchestration systems.
Strong automation and scripting skills, particularly in Python or Bash, with experience in Infrastructure as Code and GitOps methodologies.
Proven ability to build developer tooling and self service platforms (SDKs, CLI tools, templates) that abstract complexity and enable team productivity.
Understanding of compliance, security, and data governance requirements in production systems, with experience implementing these in automated pipelines.
Familiarity with architectures for LLM-powered applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the use of vector databases, would be highly regarded.
Experience with frameworks and tools for building and monitoring LLM applications, such as LangGraph, LangSmith, or Langfuse, is highly desirable.
You are a natural collaborator who believes the best work happens as a team, and you enjoy sharing what you know.
