At Petsure, we need someone who can translate cutting edge AI capabilities into practical solutions that transform how we work and serve our customers.


We are looking for an AI Solutions Engineer to be the bridge between advanced AI technologies and meaningful business outcomes. You will not just build cool tech; you will solve real problems that matter to our teams and customers. Working closely with stakeholders across the business, you will design, prototype, and deploy AI solutions that make workflows smarter, decisions faster, and experiences better.
 

What You Will Do

Build AI solutions that solve real problems. You will design and develop practical AI applications using LLMs, RAG architectures, OCR, RPA, and API integrations. You will create feedback loops and human oversight processes that ensure our solutions stay accurate and valuable over time.
Partner with the business to drive change. You will work directly with teams across the organisation to understand their workflows, pain points, and goals. You will collaborate with AI Change Champions to ensure solutions address root causes and integrate seamlessly into existing processes.
Define and measure success. You will establish operational KPIs for your solutions, track their performance, and use those insights to drive continuous improvement. You will take ownership of projects from concept to implementation, ensuring they deliver measurable value.
Elevate AI understanding across the organisation. You will run workshops and training sessions to help teams understand and responsibly use AI. You will be a trusted advisor who makes AI accessible and practical for everyone, not just the technical teams.
Champion responsible AI practices. You will ensure all solutions comply with governance standards, ethical principles, and data privacy regulations. You will proactively identify risks like bias and operational vulnerabilities, building mitigation strategies directly into your solutions.

 

What You Will Bring

2 to 4 years of experience in AI, data science, or related fields, with a proven track record of delivering AI solutions that solve real business problems.
Strong technical skills in Python and SQL, with hands on experience deploying AI technologies like LLMs and RAG workflows in production environments.
A genuine enthusiasm for LLM technology with proven experience working across multiple models. You understand the unique strengths, limitations, and cost considerations of different LLMs and can make informed decisions about which model to use for which problem.
Excellent problem solving and analytical abilities to translate messy business challenges into clean technical solutions.
Outstanding communication skills that let you explain complex AI concepts to anyone, from engineers to executives.
Experience with stakeholder engagement and the ability to build strong relationships across technical and business teams.
Understanding of ethical AI principles, governance frameworks, and what it takes to build trustworthy AI systems.
Familiarity with cloud environments (AWS, Azure, or GCP) and API based deployments would be valuable.
Experience with MLOps practices, BI tools, or frameworks like LangChain would be a plus.

Why You Will Love Working With Us

A mission you can believe in. We are a team of people who genuinely care about our purpose. Everything we build is focused on making a real, positive impact on the lives of pets and their people.
A culture of curiosity and growth. We encourage asking ""why"", exploring new possibilities, and doggedly pursuing the best solution, not just the easiest one. You will have the space to learn and tackle new challenges.
True collaboration and ownership. We work together, support each other, and celebrate our successes as a team. You will have real ownership over the solutions you build and their impact on the business.
An environment of respect. We value authenticity and believe in bringing our whole selves to work. We are building a team where everyone feels supported and appreciated for who they are.
