About the Role:

We’re looking for an experienced and hands-on Artificial Intelligence Engineering Manager to lead the design, deployment and scale of AI-driven solutions that power operational and sales efficiency across our business.

This is a newly created, unique opportunity to sit at the intersection of modern software engineering, cloud infrastructure and emerging AI technologies. You’ll lead a small, high-performing team while remaining deeply technical – shaping our AI platform, embedding intelligent workflows into core systems, and translating business needs into production-ready solutions.

If you enjoy moving between infrastructure and application layers, thrive in ambiguity, and take a consultative approach to solving complex business problems, this role is for you.

Key Responsibilities:

• Lead, mentor and develop a small team of engineers, supporting career growth and technical excellence

• Design and manage AI-specific infrastructure, taking ownership of AI platforms, specialized Kubernetes nodes, and the underlying environments required for model orchestration

• Manage and prioritise the backlog across foundational AI platform work and rapid feature delivery

• Establish best practices for testing, documentation and monitoring of AI solutions to ensure reliability and performance in production environments

• Stay current with AI trends and evaluate new tools to continuously uplift our internal AI capability

About You:

You are technically strong and adaptable, with the ability to operate confidently across both software development and infrastructure environments. You bring a consultative mindset, taking the time to understand stakeholder needs and business objectives before shaping the right technical solutions.

You are experienced in cross-collaboration, working closely with SREs, Product Managers and Sales stakeholders to ensure AI initiatives are aligned to broader business goals. Comfortable navigating different technologies, you move seamlessly from high-level ambiguity to clear, structured execution.

Essential Experience:

• 7+ years in technology roles, with a strong software engineering foundation

• 2+ years of experience in a formal leadership or engineering mentorship role, with a track record of mentoring technical talent

Technical Experience:

• AI orchestration & tooling: Deep knowledge of the modern AI stack, including agentic frameworks and AI techniques such as RAG 

• Python development: Advanced proficiency in Python for application development and data processing 

• Cloud & infrastructure: Proficiency in AWS services and Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) to manage specialized AI compute resources

• Containerisation: Familiarity with Docker and Kubernetes, specifically regarding how to deploy and scale AI-specific workloads 

• Solution design: Ability to perform requirements discovery and translate business problems into technical architectures 

• Machine learning knowledge is desirable but the focus of this role is on engineering implementation and integration rather than model research.

What's life like at Plenti?

Working at Plenti means joining a team that is high-performing, diverse, customer-focused and collaborative. It’s a place where everyone can “make it happen” and share in the results and success. If being in a dynamic industry as part of a market-leading fintech sounds like you, then join to help us reshape Australia’s financial eco-system for the good.

    •    Connect and integrate systems via APIs, webhooks, and third-party platforms

    •    Ensure automations are production-ready, with proper error handling, logging, and documentation

    •    Continuously improve existing workflows as the business scales

    •    Collaborate with leadership and teams to prioritise and deliver high-impact automation

⸻

What We’re Looking For

Essential

    •    Experience building automation workflows in real-world environments

    •    Comfortable working across multiple tools and platforms

    •    Strong understanding of APIs, data flows, and system integration

    •    Exposure to AI tools and large language models (LLMs)

    •    Logical, structured thinker who enjoys solving operational problems

    •    Able to work independently and own solutions end-to-end

Nice to Have

    •    Experience with AI agents or LLM orchestration

    •    Light coding experience (JavaScript, Python, or similar)

    •    Experience with no-code / low-code automation platforms

    •    Background in operations, product, or technical consulting

⸻

What Success Looks Like

    •    Manual processes are automated and no longer bottlenecks

    •    Systems talk to each other cleanly and reliably

    •    AI is used thoughtfully to augment workflows (not as a gimmick)

    •    Teams save time and trust the automations you’ve built

    •    Clear documentation means systems are easy to maintain and evolve

⸻

Why Join Us

    •    Work on meaningful, real-world automation problems

    •    Direct access to decision-makers and fast iteration

    •    Freedom to choose the right tools for the job

    •    Opportunity to shape how AI and automation are used across the business

    •    Flexible working arrangements

⸻

How to Apply

Please include:

Scoping and investigating requirements for new projects,

Advising and guiding customers in their choice of technologies and system architectures.

Designing, developing and commissioning PLC code and HMI interfaces

Programming inverters for induction motors and servo drive motion controls

Mentoring less experienced staff

Providing advice to installation teams,

Troubleshooting and problem solving.

About the Person

You will have an engineering or programming degree, and at least 3 years working in industry, with hands-on experience programming PLCs, HMIs, servos drives and related devices to successfully automate production processes. You will also have exceptional verbal and written English communication skills which are crucial to this role where you will be interacting with a wide variety of people from production managers to factory line workers.

Candidates must be Australian citizens or permanent residents.

Maybe you've had a series of contracts and are now looking for a permanent role with more responsibility. Perhaps you've been supporting one particular business or line and are now yearning for some more variety. Or maybe you're already a seasoned automation professional looking for your next challenge.

Whatever your journey, we'd love you to take the next step here at Integrelec.

If this sounds like the role for you, then please submit your resume, and it will be advantageous to also call our office on (07) 3123 9538 to introduce yourself."
