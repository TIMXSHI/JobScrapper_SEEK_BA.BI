Job Description


What you’d be doing in this role

As Canva scales, change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that’s all part of the fun. This will give you a flavour of the kind of things you’ll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

At the moment, this role is focused on:

• Leading a new team pioneering AI developer tooling workflows that boost engineering productivity at scale
• Driving the strategy and execution of Canva’s “AI-Orchestrated Developer Experience” goal
• Building agentic, context-aware AI systems that understand and integrate into our software development lifecycle
• Partnering with platform teams to embed intelligent capabilities across the entire developer workflow
• Mentoring and growing a high-performing team of engineers working on the frontier of AI and developer experience
• Evaluating and trialling emerging AI tools and shaping their impact across Canva Engineering

You're probably a match if:

• You’ve led high-impact engineering teams and are passionate about developer tooling/experience
• You bring a deep technical understanding of AI/ML systems, LLMs, or developer tooling
• You’ve worked with or explored tools like Cursor, Copilot, or similar coding assistants
• You thrive in ambiguity and love building 0→1 systems that scale
• You’re a collaborative leader who can influence across teams and drive outcomes without authority
• You care about building a magical developer experience and are excited to push boundaries

About the team

The AI Developer Tooling Workflows team is part of the DevX group within Canva’s Infra specialty. Our mission? Empower every Canva engineer to do the best work of their lives — faster, smarter, and with less toil. We’re evolving our tools beyond individual AI helpers into orchestrated workflows and intelligent multi-agent systems that know our codebase, conventions, and context. This is a greenfield space — and your chance to lead the future of AI-powered software development at Canva.

What’s in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard — and we do — but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connection, and fun woven throughout life at Canva too. We offer:

• Equity packages – we want our success to be yours too
• Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
• Annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
• Flexible leave options to recharge, support others, or make a positive impact
