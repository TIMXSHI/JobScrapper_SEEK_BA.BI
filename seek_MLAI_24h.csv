We have the clients. We have the use cases. We have the blueprint. Join us while we build the infrastructure that makes it real.

You'll join the team that is building the platform that deploys and manages an agentic workforce - starting with our own clients, then expanding globally to transform how businesses work.

Ship fast, learn faster: These tools are evolving weekly - we build, test, iterate

Own your decisions: No committees - you architect it, you build it, you own it

Customer-driven: Every feature ships to a real business within days

Who You'll Work With

Our exceptional team and you'll work directly with the founder, a proven entrepreneur who's built and exited companies before. No layers, no politics - direct access to leadership and immediate impact on company direction. This isn't his first rodeo, and he knows how to build both products and teams.

10-20% time for R&D/experimentation with new AI tools
