Accelerate AI adoption. Influence how we hire.

Established in 1840, we're Australia's first member-owned wellbeing company. Today we have over $1 billion in revenue and provide smart solutions and services to more than 700,000 Australians. We employ over 7000 people and our purpose is to Help People to Thrive.

It's an exciting time to be joining Australian Unity - we have grown significantly over recent years and are transforming to capitalise on further growth opportunities to help our customers and employees thrive. We operate with commercial principles and with a strong social purpose to create community value. Australian Unity is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.



Job description:



You will lead the end‑to‑end adoption of AI solutions within our People & Culture function - from identifying opportunities to delivering real business value. A major early focus will be partnering with our recruitment platform vendor to ensure their AI models meet our standards for fairness, transparency, performance, and compliance.

In this role, you will:

Lead end‑to‑end AI adoption within a business squad - from identifying opportunities and shaping requirements to solution selection, delivery, and post‑launch support.
Work directly with AI vendors - challenging assumptions, asking the right technical questions, evaluating model behaviour, ensuring fairness and performance, and influencing product direction.
Partner with internal technical and business stakeholders to shape use cases, drive adoption, build user confidence, and ensure AI solutions deliver measurable business value.
Ensure all AI initiatives meet governance, risk, and compliance expectations, and that solutions are well‑designed, documented, and aligned with enterprise standards.
Contribute to the evolution of enterprise‑level AI practices in an area such as AI literacy & change, AI governance, or AIOps / AI innovation.

You'll be part of a small, expert group helping Australian Unity become an AI‑native enterprise - and you'll have the freedom to shape how we get there.

About You:

We're looking for someone with a strong technical foundation who is ready to apply it in a more product‑oriented role. You may come from a software engineering or computer science background with hands‑on AI experience, and you've either already made the move into product-style work - or you're excited to take that next step.

You enjoy solving business problems, engaging with stakeholders, and challenging vendors with the right technical questions. You're as comfortable discussing model behaviour and risks as you are explaining concepts to non‑technical audiences.

To be successful in the role you will be able to demonstrate the following capabilities / experience:

Hands‑on industry experience (3+ years) in software engineering, AI engineering, data science, or computer science
Practical experience applying AI/ML/LLM technologies in real-world projects
Experience translating business needs into technical or product requirements
Strong communication skills with the ability to simplify complex AI concepts for non‑technical audiences
Experience delivering solutions in regulated or risk-aware environments (privacy, fairness, model behaviour) is a plus
Exposure to AI governance, AI literacy/change, AIOps/MLOps/LLMOps, model evaluation, or data privacy considerations (desirable)
Hands-on experience with low-code and automation platforms e.g., Microsoft Power Automate, Copilot Studio (desirable)

What's on Offer:

You will enjoy a range of great employee benefits and rewards including:

Competitive salary + bonus program
Enjoy additional yearly Well-Being and Community leave days
14-week paid parental leave, with equal benefit for both parents
Employee Referral Program
Employee Assistance Program - support and assistance for you and your partner at those times in life when you need it most
Maxxia Rewards - a great range of discounts and benefits at selected retail outlets, department stores, attractions, travel, cinemas, restaurants.
