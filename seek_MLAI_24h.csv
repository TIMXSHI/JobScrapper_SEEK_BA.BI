Firesoft Services (FSS) | Sydney (Hybrid/Flexible) | ABN Contractor

- Work directly with the CEO to scope, win, and deliver AI/Data engagements
- Design POCs (RAG, Agentic AI), data assessments, and light-lift implementations
- Ad-hoc/fractional model (e.g., 1–3 days/week) with flexibility around live projects

About FSS

Firesoft Services is a Sydney-based consultancy focused on Data, Cloud and AI. We help enterprise and government teams modernise data platforms, uplift governance, and stand up practical GenAI/Agentic AI pilots that stick.

The Opportunity

We’re looking for a hands-on AI/Data Consultant to partner directly with the CEO on ad-hoc engagements. You’ll jump into client discovery, shape solution options, build lean prototypes, and help turn pilots into ongoing work.

What you’ll do

Co-design solutions with clients: run discovery workshops, define scope/KPIs, and produce SoWs/proposals.

Build credible prototypes: RAG over enterprise content, Agentic AI workflows (plan→act→observe), and small data apps.

Advisory & governance: data readiness checks, security/PII guardrails, evaluation plans, and handover docs.

Integration touchpoints: wire to common tools (e.g., Teams/Email, ServiceNow/Jira, Snowflake/Databricks, AWS/GCP/Azure).

Pre-sales enablement: craft architecture diagrams, effort estimates, timelines, and client-ready decks.

Knowledge transfer: concise runbooks, enablement sessions, and “next-step” roadmaps.

What you bring

5+ years in data/ML/AI or adjacent software delivery, including client-facing work.

Hands-on with Python and one cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure). Comfort with LLM frameworks (LangChain/LangGraph/LlamaIndex), vector stores, and retrieval patterns.

Solid grasp of governance & safety (prompt safety, PII redaction, audit logs, human-in-the-loop).

Ability to talk to execs and engineers: convert business pain into a pragmatic, measurable pilot.

Comfortable with ad-hoc/fractional engagement style and moving fast on small, high-impact deliverables.

Sydney or Australian-time-zone based.

Nice to have: Snowflake/Databricks; ServiceNow/Jira integrations; MLOps basics; experience in retail, financial services, or government.

Why Firesoft

Direct impact: sit 1:1 with the CEO on strategy, bids, and delivery.

Variety & velocity: tight POCs that turn into real programs.

Flexibility: shape your weeks around live engagements (ABN contractor).

Reach: access to enterprise/gov clients and a pipeline that needs sharp operators.
