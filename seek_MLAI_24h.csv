Rubidium develops automation and inspection solutions for the sports and lighting industries. Our flagship product, the RB Rover, is a field robot that performs sports lighting audits — driving measurement grids across sports fields to collect illumination and positional data for compliance, reporting and design feedback.

We are now entering the next phase of RB Rover’s development: redesigning its body for durability and manufacturability, and upgrading its Cube-based navigation and control system for robust, repeatable, autonomous operation.

The Role

We’re looking for a Robotics Product Engineer (Mechanical & Controls) to take ownership of the redesign and system upgrades. You’ll work hands-on across mechanical design, control system integration, and field testing, delivering a production-ready robot that can reliably complete missions in real-world sports-field conditions.

Key responsibilities

Redesign RB Rover’s chassis and sensor mast(s) with a focus on durability, weather resistance, weight distribution, and serviceability.

Engineer mounting and wiring solutions for payloads (lux meters, LiDAR, GNSS, cameras, IMU, encoders).

Design for manufacture — materials selection, processes, and production drawings.

Implement and tune navigation/control systems leveraging the Cube autopilot system (CubePilot/ArduPilot ecosystem).

Integrate and calibrate sensors into the Cube stack; develop robust sensor-fusion pipelines (GNSS, LiDAR, IMU, encoders).

Improve motion control, safety limits, and power management (battery systems, BMS integration, swap procedures).

Plan and conduct field testing, collecting telemetry and iterating designs.

Deliver complete engineering documentation (CAD, BOM, wiring diagrams, parameter sets, software/firmware notes, test reports, and maintenance guides).

About you

Must have:

Degree in Mechanical, Mechatronics, Robotics Engineering, or equivalent.

3–7+ years experience designing outdoor/industrial products.

Hands-on robotics/control system experience with CubePilot/ArduPilot or PX4.

Strong skills in CAD (SolidWorks, Fusion360, or similar).

Embedded systems experience: Cube autopilot integration, motor controllers, companion computers.

Field testing and iteration experience.

Nice to have:

Experience with RTK GNSS, LiDAR-based SLAM/localization.

Designing to IP ratings (IP54–IP65).

Industrial design or ergonomics experience.

Prior experience with outdoor inspection/agricultural robots.

Knowledge of DFMA and supplier engagement in Australia/APAC.

Tools & platforms you’ll use

Cube autopilot (CubePilot/ArduPilot, MAVLink)

ROS/ROS2 for higher-level logic

CAD: SolidWorks / Fusion360

LiDAR, GNSS, IMU, cameras

Embedded platforms: Cube + companion computer (Jetson/Raspberry Pi)

What success looks like

Robust Cube-based navigation stack that completes ≥95% of missions without manual rescue.

Positional repeatability of <0.2 m across audit grids.

Serviceable, weather-resistant body design ready for production.

Comprehensive documentation for manufacturing and operation.

Why join us?

Be part of a pioneering robotics product in the sports technology sector.

Hands-on role with direct impact from design through to field deployment.

Flexible work pattern, based in Queensland with real-world testing on sports fields.

Contract or permanent pathway available.

How to apply

If you’re passionate about robotics, control systems, and designing for the real world, we’d love to hear from you.

Two Dot AI | Full-Stack AI Engineer | $125-150k AUD

The Opportunity

We're building the deployment and management platform for autonomous AI agents for business. Not chatbots. Actual agents that run entire business workflows.

We have the clients. We have the use cases. We have the blueprint. Join us while we build the infrastructure that makes it real.

You'll join the team that is building the platform that deploys and manages an agentic workforce - starting with our own clients, then expanding globally to transform how businesses work.

Who We're After

Looking for someone who wants to embrace AI-vibe coding — moving fast, iterating, and working in a way that avoids too much spaget.

You'll:

Ship, build, test and deploy AI Agents.

Help shape the platform as it comes online (devops experience would be really nice).

Optionally dip into client-facing work (""Forward Deployed Engineer""), but not required.

Jack of all trades: UI / Backend / Databases / Infra Devops / Saftey Testing / Cloud / Mentoring Interns

The Technical Challenge

You'll work with:

AI Coding Tools: Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Open Router, Warp and many others.

Google Cloud AI Stack: Vertex AI Agent Builder, Extensions, Search & Conversation

MCP Servers: Build and host Model Context Protocol servers for business integrations

Multi-cloud Architecture: Start with GCP, extend to Azure/AWS for enterprise clients

Event-driven Systems: Real-time streaming, pub/sub, agent orchestration

Agent Infrastructure: Memory management, context handling, monitoring, self-healing

We don't expect you to know all of the above AI tools - they're too new. We need someone with the foundational skills to master them quickly.

Core Requirements

Must-haves:

2+ years shipping production code (or exceptional ability proven otherwise)

Strong Google Cloud Platform experience or simliar in Azure/AWS

Proven distributed systems and API design skills

Experience with event-driven architectures and streaming systems

Daily AI coding tool user (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot)

Exceptional async communication

Must have existing Australian work authorisation

Standout signals:

Built platforms that scale (not just apps)

Comfortable learning bleeding-edge tech from docs and experiments

Experience with auth patterns, API gateways, observability

Can architect systems from concept to production

History of 10x productivity gains using AI tools

How We Build

AI-accelerated everything: If you're not using AI to code at 10x speed, you're already behind

Ship fast, learn faster: These tools are evolving weekly - we build, test, iterate

Own your decisions: No committees - you architect it, you build it, you own it

Customer-driven: Every feature ships to a real business within days

Who You'll Work With

Our exceptional team and you'll work directly with the founder, a proven entrepreneur who's built and exited companies before. No layers, no politics - direct access to leadership and immediate impact on company direction. This isn't his first rodeo, and he knows how to build both products and teams.

The Package

Cash: $125,000 - $150,000 AUD

Growth:

Direct path to senior positions in this expanding role

10-20% time for R&D/experimentation with new AI tools

All cloud and AI certifications covered

Daily collaboration with proven technical leadership

Reality check: This is intense, focused building. We ship when it's ready, not on arbitrary timelines. If you want predictable 9-5, this isn't it. If you want to build tools that fundamentally change how businesses operate, you've found your place.

Why Two Dot AI?

Cutting edge: Using tools that most developers haven't heard of yet

Real impact: Our agents are already saving clients 30% of their time

Funded & focused: Seed closed, products delivered, clear vision, paying customers

Small & fast: No bureaucracy, no meetings about meetings
