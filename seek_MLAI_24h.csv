1 day in office/4 from home

The Opportunity:
Want to build production-grade AI that operates on real-world signal data, not lab experiments?

This role is for an ML Engineer who wants to own models end-to-end — from raw time-series inputs through to deployed, high-accuracy event detection in production.

You’ll be working on complex, high-frequency data (think Wi-Fi, sensor, or similar telemetry) and turning noisy signals into reliable, real-time classifications using modern deep learning techniques.
This is a hands-on engineering role, not research-led. You’ll ship models, improve them, and see them used.
What You’ll Be Doing
Design, train, and deploy deep learning models for time-series and signal classification
Build models that capture temporal patterns using architectures such as LSTMs, GRUs, and Transformers
Own the full ML lifecycle — prototyping, evaluation, optimisation, and production deployment
Define and maintain feature engineering pipelines (windowing, normalisation, signal transformations)
Set and track model performance benchmarks in real-world environments
Work closely with data engineers to shape data contracts and ETL pipelines
Continuously improve model accuracy, latency, and robustness as data scales
What We’re Looking For
2+ years of commercial ML experience in applied, production environments
Strong hands-on experience building deep learning models (not just training notebooks)
Practical expertise with sequential / time-series models (LSTM, GRU, Transformer-based)
Proven experience working with time-series, signal, Wi-Fi, sensor, or telemetry data
Solid Python skills across the ML stack (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, deep learning frameworks)
Experience taking models from concept to production
Background in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, or a related quantitative discipline"
