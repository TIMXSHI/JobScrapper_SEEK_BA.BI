What you'll be doing:
Define and own the AI architecture strategy across a multi-billion dollar organisation.
Lead the design of scalable, production-ready AI/ML solutions across multiple domains (yes, including GenAI - but not only GenAI).
Partner with product, data, and engineering leaders to make things happen. No siloes. No lip service.
Embed responsible AI frameworks - because scale without governance isn't innovation, it's a time bomb.
Be the voice that translates technical complexity into boardroom clarity.


What you bring:
A track record of building real-world AI systems - not just lab experiments or vendor demos.
Deep knowledge across ML ops, model lifecycle, cloud platforms (GCP/AWS/Azure), and LLMs.
Gravitas. You can hold your own with engineers and executives - and know when to challenge both.
Telco experience? Great. But if you've worked in any complex, regulated, data-heavy environment, you'll fit right in.
