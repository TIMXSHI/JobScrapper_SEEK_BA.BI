At Intelligent Robotics, we design and deliver novel industrial automation and robotic systems that change how entire processes operate. Much of what we work on doesn’t come with a playbook — and that’s exactly why our engineers are here.

About the role

As an Automation & Robotics Engineer, you’ll play a key role in designing, programming and commissioning complex mechatronic systems across a range of industries.  You’ll work closely with a small, highly capable team to:

●      Concept and develop automation and robotics solutions, often in applications that have never been automated before

●      Translate concepts into electrical design, PLC programming (structured text), and robotic programming

●      Integrate controls, robotics, mechanical systems and software into cohesive solutions

●      Commission systems on-site and bring designs into reality

●      Stay at the forefront of automation technology and apply new approaches where they add real value

You’ll also gain exposure to areas such as PC programming (C++), machine vision and AI, depending on project needs and your skillset.

We think our values tell you a lot about us and how we work:

●      Teamwork – we think ‘Team’ for us and our customers, we help and support each other, and we keep each other safe

●      Enjoyment – we’re driven and genuinely enjoy what we do, and build a confident ‘can-do’ positive atmosphere.

●      Openness – no BS, no blame.  We focus on attacking problems, not people.

●      Creativity and courage – we like to push boundaries, act nimbly, and question things

●      Results – we set lofty goals, and take great pride when we hit them

What makes you a great fit

You don’t need to tick every box, but you likely bring:

●      Experience delivering automation projects with PLC programming (comfortable in structured text) and robotic systems

●      End-to-end project experience — from concept and design through to on-site commissioning

●      A genuine interest in R&D-style problem solving and learning new technologies

●      Confidence working closely with others and challenging ideas constructively

●      Comfort working across different industries and technical environments

Growth here isn’t generic training — it’s learning through real problems, so expect exposure to new industries, technologies and system architectures. You will be supported to develop skills that improve outcomes (technical or otherwise).

Some considerations which might not make this the role for you:

●      The work can be intense, especially when commissioning complex systems

●      Projects involve site work, sometimes for extended periods

●      We work on problems that can be frustrating before they’re rewarding

●      You’ll work across industries including manufacturing, meat processing and mining

●      On-site travel required during commissioning and support phases, with hybrid working arrangements (mix of home and office) in other project phases.

About us

Intelligent Robotics Pty Ltd is a leading provider of industrial automation and robotic solutions across food manufacturing, mining and infrastructure. We are dedicated to helping our clients achieve greater productivity, efficiency and sustainability. We’re known for solving complex problems with practical, innovative engineering — and for how we treat our people.

But at a time when society is changing, we are too. We’re now a nimbler business with new leadership and thinking. 

For us, these are exciting times. There’s a real potential for big thinkers to help us redefine what financial services could be and turn our legacy into something even more positive and powerful for the future.

Help people create their tomorrow, while you create yours

We help people with their banking, super, retirement and finances. Through upturns, downturns, recessions, and major life transitions. Every day, we help people see and make more of their financial potential, so that they can create their tomorrow. And we’ve been doing it for over 170 years. 

If we do our job well, we genuinely add to the prosperity of our country and its people.

As a Senior Data Scientist within AMP Bank’s Data, Analytics & Insights team, you will help transform the Bank into a data‑driven organisation. You will lead advanced modelling, improve data accessibility and support strategic decision‑making across credit risk, operations, finance and customer domains

How will you make an impact

Make data available and accessible for the business.
Build and maintain predictive and stress‑testing models.
Partner with Data Platforms and Bank IT on data ingestion and consumption.
Drive automation of applications and data processes.
Deliver analytics and business insights through modelling and visualisation.
Support data flow and infrastructure for existing Stress Testing models.
Contribute to deployment activities across Credit Risk Analytics.
Build industry‑standard solutions using AWS.
Collaborate with external providers including credit bureaus, property data providers and decision systems vendors.

What you will bring to the role 

Ideally at least 3–5 years’ experience with R and SQL (with additional languages desirable), strong reporting and visualisation capability with RStudio Shiny and exceptional proficiency in creating and implementing plumber APIs. 
Undergraduate degree in Statistics, Data Engineering, Information Management, Mathematics or Physics, with hands‑on experience using RStudio, Jira and Confluence. 
Background in financial services, ideally Credit Risk, Finance or Operations, combined with practical experience working in AWS environments. 
Prior experience managing a small team and the ability to influence senior stakeholders without direct authority. 
Commercially astute with a strong strategic focus and proven experience delivering against project timelines.

What we look for in you

You are a curious, collaborative problem‑solver who can translate complex data into meaningful insights. You thrive in ambiguity and can balance strategic thinking with hands‑on delivery. You build collaborative relationships, communicate clearly with technical and non‑technical stakeholders and enjoy contributing to a culture of learning, innovation and continuous improvement. You also bring an entrepreneurial mindset and a strong interest in shaping AMP’s digital bank of the future.

Your exposure to AI/ML and experience building AI/ML use-case frameworks will be well regarded

You’ll thrive here if…

If you can adapt from BAU to the ambiguous with ease, you’ll do well here. Change is never easy, so bring your commitment, grit and growth mindset.

Because we run lean, you’ll be expected to jump in and deliver across a variety of areas. Meaning, you’ll be closer to the action and executive decisions that influence where we go next.

If you’re someone that can hold their own, you’ll find AMP quite liberating.

Why we think you’ll love working at AMP

Doing what we’ve always done is not an option, so your clever ideas will get airtime here. You’ll be encouraged to speak up and try new things. If they don’t work, we move on – better for it.

We know there’s no one way of doing things. So, you won’t have to sacrifice who you are or how you work to fit in here. We’re inclusive and flexible in many of the ways you’d expect. And in some of the ways you wouldn’t. As long as your health and wellbeing come first - at home and at work. 

In fact, most of what makes AMP such a welcoming, enjoyable place to work are our people. Wherever you go, you’ll find moments to connect, feel valued and do meaningful work. 

Whether it’s through our first-class leaders who are invested in you and your success. Through year-round opportunities to volunteer, fundraise and give back to the community. Or in the everyday challenges you face as we work together to strengthen this great organisation. Challenges that will stretch you, amplify your potential and compound the impact you have. 

We believe in the power of inclusion and diversity

We’re dedicated to fostering inclusion, diversity, and a warm feeling of belonging at AMP.

At Smartmoney Wealth Management, we’re building technology to make money clear, visible, and actionable in a world where finances are increasingly digital and fragmented.

Alongside our core advice business, we have already commenced building a new AI-driven financial intelligence platform. The next phase is execution — getting it live, reliable, and delivering real outcomes.

We’re looking for an experienced AI Solutions Engineer to help finish, deploy, and scale this platform, while also applying AI to improve internal processes across the Smartmoney business.

The role

This is a hands-on execution role.

You will:

Take an already-started AI platform and get it live and working correctly

Build, refine, and deploy AI systems using real financial and property data

Implement LLM- and agent-based systems where they create measurable efficiency

Improve internal workflows at Smartmoney using AI (analysis, automation, decision support)

Work directly with the founders and senior team

Own delivery, not just design

This is not a research or advisory role. It is about deploying and improving real systems.

Who this is for

You are an experienced AI engineer who:

Has deployed AI systems into production

Is comfortable working end-to-end with imperfect data

Enjoys taking something part-built and making it work properly

Can balance speed, quality, and reliability

Wants their work used daily, not parked in a roadmap

Fintech or regulated-environment experience is useful, not mandatory.

Location & compensation

Hybrid (Australia-based)

Competitive salary

Equity available for the right candidate

Why this role matters

You’ll help bring a new AI platform from build to live

You’ll directly improve how a real wealth management business operates

You’ll work closely with decision-makers, not through layers

Strong pathway to expanded technical leadership as the platform scales
