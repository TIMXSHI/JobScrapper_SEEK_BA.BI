Description & Requirements


Bloomberg delivers critical information in a world where information matters. We give influential decision makers in business, finance and government an edge by connecting them to a dynamic network of news, people and ideas. To do that, we need a constant flow of ideas, energy, innovation—which is where you come in. At Bloomberg, you will have the opportunity to go above and beyond and to take risks.  

Financial firms rely on dozens of critical systems to develop and execute strategies, evaluate risk, supervise P&L, lead sales and trading, and handle settlement. The constant challenge is the complexity of integrating these systems so that data moves accurately across the enterprise, at higher speeds and lower costs. Building solutions in-house can take a large team and a larger investment. Integrators and consultants may not understand a firm’s business model or data, or not offer the ongoing support required to maintain and improve the solution once live. 

That’s where we come in. Here at Enterprise Technology Solutions, we help firms implement and handle that complexity. By providing common tools, services and expertise, we enable firms to simplify technology relationships, which ultimately drive lower total cost of ownership, faster time to market and improved transparency. With our track record in delivering hosted solutions and our understanding of our customers’ needs, we believe we are uniquely positioned to help clients with this challenge. 

What's the role?  

As an Integration Specialist supporting our ever growing business, you will be responsible for technical integration between our clients systems and Bloomberg's world-class applications. Integrations often involve crafting and deploying solutions for clients looking to integrate their systems with the Bloomberg cloud, but can also involve integrating client systems with other in-house or 3rd party sources or destinations. This process requires holding technical conversations, at both pre-sales and project stages, with our clients in order to build an understanding of their workflow and specific needs. 

In this role, you will be responsible for client projects involving building and certifying new trading workflows between the client and the Bloomberg cloud and/or other 3rd party systems. It will also involve the scoping and development of data transformation middleware technology that supports both real-time and batch-based processing via Bloomberg iPaaS. These solutions can support XML, FIX, FpML/SWIFT messaging protocols, as well as MQ, SFTP, ODBC, and various product APIs.  

We’ll trust you to: 

- Design, configure, integrate, test, and lead implementation projects, working directly with clients as well as alongside various internal teams to ensure our clients have strong and secure connectivity and integration to Bloomberg applications  

- Resolve project related implementation issues in a timely fashion through collaboration with various internal teams to ensure minimal downtime  

- Ensure a smooth life-cycle experience for our clients in moving from project implementation to production support by building a deep understanding of their workflows and communicating them effectively to the relevant teams  

- Build a comprehensive understanding of the features and capabilities of our suite of products through on the job learning and training to manage client queries quickly and efficiently  

- Improve processes, best practices, and enhance efficiency in on-boarding setups and connections through proactively identifying gaps to deliver improved client experience  

- Manage multiple projects simultaneously with different priorities in an agile and efficient manner   

- Demonstrate willingness to learn and adaptability to rapid changes  

You’ll need to have:  

- 5+ years of experience in the financial industry supporting trading workflows in one or more of the following asset classes: Equities, FI, FX  

- 5+ years of experience using some or all the following financial data transfer / messaging protocols: FIX, MQ, SFTP, SWIFT, Web APIs 

- 1+ years of experience troubleshooting networks and connectivity issues (including LAN/WAN & TCP/IP)  

- Demonstrated knowledge of EMS/OMS integrations  

- Experience with Unix/Linux operating systems and commands in the past 1 year 

- Demonstrated experience successfully managing multiple projects to meet required deliverables, including communicating progress and outcomes to relevant stakeholders  

- Ability to work independently and build successful relationships with external customers  

- Ability to proactively identify gaps within existing processes and taking the initiative to improve them by defining and piloting new procedures  

- Excellent written and verbal communication skill in English 

- Demonstrated continuous career growth within an organisation 

- Bachelor’s degree or degree-equivalent qualifications 

We’d love to see:  

- Experience with FIX on-boarding  

- Experience applying Data Transformation to workflows using any ETL tools (e.g. Informatica / Mulesoft / TIBCO / Dell Boomi) or through transformation languages (e.g. XML XSLT / Perl)  

- Experience with IT Service Management or client relationship management  

- Experience with programming / scripting  

- Basic understanding of cloud technologies e.g. AWS, Azure  

- Business fluency in any additional Asian language is a plus, to enhance the support experience for our clients around the APAC region"
