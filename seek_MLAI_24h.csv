What you’d be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

This role will see you:

Building world-class AI infrastructure to support a 100+ person research team at the forefront of creative AI

Designing and scaling multi-cloud systems that support high-performance model training and inference

Partnering across AWS, GCP, Cloudflare and GCore to optimise GPU compute environments

Enhancing CI/CD pipelines and developer velocity within our AI platform teams

Improving monitoring, alerting and system observability for AI workloads

Driving alignment in DevOps best practices across the AI platform and CORE engineering teams

Leading a high-impact engineering team in a fast-paced, cutting-edge environment

You're probably a match if

You’ve led DevOps or infrastructure teams, ideally in AI or high-performance computing environments

You’ve worked closely with AI researchers or research teams, enabling experimentation, model training, or evaluation at scale
You’ve built or led infrastructure that prioritises research velocity and reliability, not just production uptime

You’re experienced with AWS (ECS, EC2, S3, IAM) and multi-cloud environments like GCP, Cloudflare or GCore

You’ve worked with Kubernetes, SLURM, or similar distributed training infrastructure

You’re fluent in infrastructure as code tools like Terraform

You understand the lifecycle of AI models and how to support R&D at scale

You have a strong grasp of containerisation, Linux fundamentals, and cloud networking

You’re collaborative, curious, and passionate about enabling others to move fast and safely

About the team

You’ll be joining CORE (Canva Original Research & Exploration) — our in-house AI research lab. CORE brings together researchers, engineers, and infrastructure specialists to build world-class models that unlock creativity at scale. With over 100 researchers already in the team, this role is foundational to scaling our AI training and inference capabilities as we push the boundaries of what's possible in product-integrated AI.

About the Group/Team

Canva Research – Design Generation

We’re building the systems that turn imagination into reality. Within Canva Research, the Design Generation group focuses on creating AI models and pipelines that produce beautiful designs for Canvas users. We work at the intersection of research and product, partnering closely with Product, Design, and Engineering to ship AI-powered experiences that feel magical, reliable, and deeply human. Our work directly shapes how users create, explore, and express ideas in Canva every day.

About the Role/Specialty:

As a Senior Research Engineer, we sit at the boundary between research and production. We explore new ideas in generative modelling, evaluate their real-world impact, and turn promising research into scalable systems that power Canva’s design experiences. As a Senior Research Engineer, this role operates with a high degree of autonomy, solving complex problems, influencing technical direction, and collaborating across teams to deliver meaningful outcomes. Our success is measured not just by research quality, but by the impact our work has on real users.

What you’ll do (responsibilities):

You’ll design, experiment with, and evaluate generative AI models for design-focused use cases.

You’ll translate research outcomes into scalable, production-ready systems.

You’ll collaborate closely with Product, Design, and Engineering partners to align research with user needs.

You’ll analyse model performance using both quantitative metrics and qualitative user signals.

You’ll contribute to technical discussions, architecture decisions, and long-term AI strategy.

You’ll share learnings through documentation, reviews, and internal presentations to uplift the broader team.

What we're looking for:


You’re an accomplished applied researcher who loves seeing ideas land in the hands of real users. You’re comfortable navigating ambiguity, balancing research depth with practical constraints, and making thoughtful trade-offs. You bring solid experience in machine learning or generative modelling, enjoy collaborating across disciplines, and care deeply about quality, ethics, and impact. You’re motivated by solving meaningful problems at scale and excited by the challenge of building AI that empowers creativity.

Experience with generative models: Proficient in working with large language models (LLMs), diffusion models, and multimodal architectures to develop innovative solutions.

Skills in training generative models: Experienced in techniques such as fine-tuning, in-context learning, and reinforcement learning to optimise model performance.

Proficiency in deep learning frameworks: Skilled in leveraging tools like PyTorch, JAX, and HuggingFace for advanced research and experimentation.

Expertise in experimental design and evaluation: Capable of implementing experimental design strategies for generative models, using both quantitative metrics and qualitative analysis to assess outcomes.

Ability to enhance research tooling and workflows: Experienced in rapid prototyping, conducting ablation studies, and tracking experiments to streamline research processes.

Competence in data curation and analysis: Adept at managing and analysing datasets for training and evaluating generative systems.

Familiarity with current research literature: Skilled at reproducing impactful papers and applying novel techniques to address emerging problem spaces.
