maxon makes electric DC motors for the coolest applications in the world. Google us. 




The job

We're looking for a software developer who thrives on solving real problems, improving tools, and learning as they go. If you take pride in your work, enjoy understanding how things tick, from hardware to high-level code, and prefer building over buzzwords, you'll fit right in.

Our projects span digital and physical domains. You might be writing Python to automate a system, diving into C++ for embedded control, or helping connect sensors to cloud services. We work with mechanical systems, robotics, embedded layers, and front-end interfaces, so curiosity and adaptability are key.

We care about how you think. If you've built things, broken them, fixed them better, and can explain why, we should have a chat.




What You'll Work With

Core technologies: Python and the C family (C/C++/C#).

Cloud deployment, databases, documentation, and source control.

Systems that bridge software and hardware — real machines, sensors, and designs.

Collaboration happens on site where you'll engage directly with the engineering team.




What We Value

Eagerness to learn new technologies and improve old ones.

Pride in craftsmanship and job performance.

Willingness to innovate and help the team level up.

Enjoyment of tackling challenges and solving problems that matter.

Some of our work connects the digital and physical worlds. Your work could involve building software that connects with sensors, controls mechanical systems, or interfaces with robotics. If the idea of software interacting with real machines excites you, you'll find plenty to dig into here.




Why Join Us

We're a team that experiments, learns, and builds with purpose. We value clear thinking, honest communication, and pride in results. You'll have room to grow, space to contribute, and support to do your best work.

If this sounds like you, let's talk.
